The Shawshank Redemption~17 February 2021~An incredible movie. One that lives with you.~It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~21 November 2005~Don't Rent Shawshank.~"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~18 February 2008~This is How Movies Should Be Made~"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~25 March 1999~The Shawshank Redemption~"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.878 out of 1,051 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~8 October 2020~the shawshank redemption~The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 July 1999~Stephen King's best adapted movie~Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~15 June 2018~Eternal Hope~I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~6 November 2014~IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time~Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~23 February 2020~My favorite movie of all time.~The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!? ~0
The Shawshank Redemption~6 February 1999~"Simply known as ""The Movie"""~"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~8 February 2001~Prepare to be moved~I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.1,632 out of 1,877 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? ~0
The Shawshank Redemption~13 November 2019~Simply the best~There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~27 August 2002~Shawshank Redeems Hollywood~Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~2 August 2016~"The UNIVERSALITY of Shawshank: Andy Dufresne as ""EVERYMAN"""~"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL ------------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!--------------If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be some of you out there!... What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its release!In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! ....I invite you to check!In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance"" Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the ""predestined to an untimely end"" sidekick!... The entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS!I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-dropping...but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend-A starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U. S.! Overall...1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in!My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go by myself!!! My wife, who is a rather avid moviegoer, said...""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW- What? No, Thanks!... I PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated...so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites and have seen it numerous times! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994!I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated!... Each one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette...WOW!!!!!!!As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to the USA, invariably, is the route that comes to mind...not the opposite, right!?!?!?Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlessly!!! Can't go into any more detail without treading into SP**LER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages!10********** STARS.... ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~1 July 2005~never give up hope~"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~30 December 2007~Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film~"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 December 2015~From my favorite movies..~It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~16 July 2013~The Greatest Movie of all Time~Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~28 December 2015~impressive~not for a reason. but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. a film who reminds more than presents. values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. short - a film who must see !? ~0
The Shawshank Redemption~30 July 1998~A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.~This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.? ~0
The Shawshank Redemption~2 August 1998~The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced~This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph. Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me. Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity. It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie. It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art. This is what movies were meant to be.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~4 December 2021~I Know My Name Is Captain Obvious~This is the sole film in the world that is over 2 hours and yet I wanted another 2. The story, the acting, the sense of justice, the acting, the triumph of good but not in a linear manner, the acting and certainly the authentic feel of the era make this a justified masterpiece.Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.Keep churning out the stand up comic Thor, Hollywood.? ~9

Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.~9
The Shawshank Redemption~4 February 2003~Sublimely powerful.~"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.? "~0
The Shawshank Redemption~4 September 2005~When There is Life, There is Hope; When There is Hope, There is Life~"Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. ""When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!"" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~12 March 2006~One of my favourites...~"*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy finds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price.As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he accepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is ""get busy living or get busy dying"".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~2 October 2021~Masterpiece~This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~4 September 2022~Compensatory Incarceration...~What would you do, if the world came down on you, wrongly sentenced for a crime, that will take all your life's time; you're quite gentle and quite shy, don't feel the need to shout or cry, so you take it on the chin, accept the view, and settle in.Then distractions take their toll, incarceration's in control, prison guards dealing in pain, fellow cons who can't refrain; new friends help, you're not alone, surrounded by these walls of stone, movie pinups play their part, to lift spirits and keep good heart.Soon the governor fills his tills, make's the most of all your skills, he's an unforgiving kind, but there's money to be mined; you disperse what you collect, keeping covered all aspects, knowing channels have been primed, and overwhelmingly begrimed.Perpetually entertaining stuff.? ~8
The Shawshank Redemption~10 August 2017~Best movie of all time!~"The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~27 November 2011~life changing~I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~25 October 2007~An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective..~At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~3 January 2006~Hope is everything~"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~7 October 2019~One of the most powerful movies I've ever watched~The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 March 2009~A Sort of Secular Redemption~"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10"~9
The Shawshank Redemption~25 July 2010~Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.~"Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended."~0
The Shawshank Redemption~7 February 2013~"""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged"""~"""Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM""Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""My Rating - 10/10"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~30 November 2017~its an excellent piece of art~i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 November 2020~Simply Wonderful~One of the best movies ever made. Simple as that. Top 20 ever, and top 3 of the 90s. The ending is just so powerful.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~5 March 2016~This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.~The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~31 July 2003~One of the Best If You Get It~"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie. Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen. Others are action junkies. Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle. For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people. That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly. It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray. But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done. And THAT is filmmaking at its finest. Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled."~9
The Shawshank Redemption~15 October 2021~A Middle Finger To Pigs Everywhere~WHAT. A. MOVIEIt is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!Clever, moralistic and entertaining.Hollywood has done very few consequential movies since (V For Vendetta, Captain Fantastic and perhaps Watchmen..) so grab this one if you have not watched it.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~3 April 2020~i swear~I have never watched a better movie than this before? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~11 September 2003~Number two? Fine by me **** (out of ****)~I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time. That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out. Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased. There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank. Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this. Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance. If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~1 October 2019~So amazing~The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~23 December 2012~Better Late Then Never~Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)~10
The Shawshank Redemption~12 November 2001~Why it is ranked so highly.~"Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was ranked so high, and many ""wished"" that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is my take on the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several ""hot"" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better.This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where ""Shawshank Redemption"" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a ""10"", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has their own opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less.And this one offers a lot."~0
The Shawshank Redemption~22 April 2003~Excellent Stephen King adaptation; flawless Robbins & Freeman~"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived ""prison film"" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director.? "~0
The Shawshank Redemption~25 April 2021~Top Three Favorite Movies~This film is easily in my top three favorite films. I return to it time and time again, still captivated! Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~4 May 2012~Richly human, uplifting~"Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason....""

The Shawshank Redemption~7 June 2020~The Shawshank Redemption~The classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~23 September 2019~Truly the greatest prison movie ever!~So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and 25th anniversary plus Stephen King turned 72 recently! I admit I've been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time, I cried, I laughed, felt sympathy, and was very immersed.Truly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it, I love the movie a lot now; Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character! Frank Darabont made such a crafty, dark and heart wrenching experience! Fathom events is excellent, I am glad I paid over $13 dollars to see such drama perfected film.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~2 April 2021~A Popular Film That Deserves Its Popularity~If you like hopeful, surprising, never-seen-before characters, you will enjoy this amusing story of a family of prisoners victimized by the system and a Bible thumping pig.Robbins and Freeman, and everybody else, gives perfect performances for their characters. Their actions and body languages are perfect for this story and movie.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~31 January 2006~A melodramatic, motherf***ing masterpiece~"In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT!As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS!I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~17 December 2012~Now here is a classic~"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com"~9
The Shawshank Redemption~30 August 2020~Classic~This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~4 November 2000~Relentless Storytelling~I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.~0
The Shawshank Redemption~4 August 2010~My #1~"I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!?

The Shawshank Redemption~26 June 2020~Fantastic Film~This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~11 June 2019~mksl akteb review w elli t7t dah mosh bta3y~"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~14 February 2021~Perfection!~Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a well educated banker, is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary. This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guards.Saw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned. This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating. The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz. Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~9 April 2009~The best film ever made!~'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece!

The Shawshank Redemption~13 October 2018~A CLASSIC~This film will stand the test of time And it will remain one of the best films ever madePlease do not remake this gem It must be left alone..Superb? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~15 July 2021~A Revolution in Storytelling~It's difficult to review a movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.Want to know something amazing? Look at the director's credits. Not into cashing in, is he?? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~5 March 2020~Beautiful movie~Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~21 May 2006~A bit overrated, but still an amazing film~It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10~9
The Shawshank Redemption~5 June 2020~10 out of 10~Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~23 February 2021~This Review Is Unneeded~You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~26 December 2000~Well Worth A Read.~"I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome.? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~12 April 1999~Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .~"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."~7
The Shawshank Redemption~28 December 1998~A Truly Uplifting Film~Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~16 March 2006~I didn't think films could be this good....~The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA.A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails.The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10~10
The Shawshank Redemption~1 July 2019~Really good adapted screenplay but that's not enough to being the top rated movie of all time.~Storyline is really good so it's a story from Stephen King's book, how can be bad? But that's not enough to be the top rated movie of all time.But people are confused about something. That thing is this movie is not the best movie of all time, it is the highest rated movie. That makes it doesn't matter your age or gender or what genre you like, you'll like this movie. Yes, it can be your favorite movie but objectively I won't trust your opinion on movies that much.The movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie. Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good. But this movie average quality of Cinematography, Scores and Sound Effects. Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time. The Green Mile is directed by same person, Frank Darabont. And that movie has amazing Screenplay, Film Editing, Acting Cinematography, Makeups, Costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration. All of them are really good, just scores are average. But as I sad in this movie we don't have amazing Cinematography, Film Editing, Original Scores...~9
The Shawshank Redemption~25 December 2008~Oh my godmother~Three words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~9 February 2022~Outstanding~Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.? ~8
The Shawshank Redemption~8 December 2013~Freeman gives it depth~Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.~8
The Shawshank Redemption~24 April 2004~Over Rated~There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.? ~7
The Shawshank Redemption~13 August 2006~Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film~If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10~9
The Shawshank Redemption~20 December 2015~Superb~"Superb movie.Based on a Stephen King short story, the story of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), sent to prison for murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he is befriended by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who helps him survive the harsh prison life.A beautiful, moving story. Characters are steadily and solidly developed, and you feel an empathy for the main characters. Direction by Frank Darabont is subtle, and perfect. Pacing is spot- on.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in the lead roles. Freeman got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.Well deserving of all the praise heaped upon it. Just a pity it didn't garner any Oscars, losing out, in the most part, to a far inferior movie, Forrest Gump."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~3 June 2010~Mystery~I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.? ~7
The Shawshank Redemption~25 June 2014~Shawshank Redemption Comes Out Clean~What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a prison movie, yes, but it is so much more than that. First, let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it: Stephen King for writing this magnum opus, Frank Darabont for his stellar directing, Tim Robbins for the job he did and, of course, Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movie.This was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike. It was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and rectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You couldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You couldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the happy ending.Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It didn't get the awards it deserved, but like the Utah Jazz in the late 90's playing the Bulls, Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition. Although, it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~29 May 2007~When they give you life, that's what they take~"Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the ""Sisters"" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****"~9
The Shawshank Redemption~17 March 2019~#1 on IMDB's top 250, one of the best movies of all time and more than 6200 reviews... what's more to say about this movie?~As I said in the summary, there are too many reviews for this movie and it's among the best movies of all time. So, why I wanted to review it? Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs. This is out of my system, now I can go to the review.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it). Everything in this movie is perfect: the dialogue is clever and well written, with many great lines (included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman), the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in 1990s movies, and the performances are very strong and heartfelt. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers. Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning, but more the movie goes on more you come to like him. Freeman also narrates the movie, and here is suave, easy to empathize with and likeable (as in all his other movies). And also the supporting players in the movie are good, including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks Hatlen.My favourite scene apart the tear-jerking ending? The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers. So, you don't have to like prison dramas for liking this movie. Yes it's depressing and sad in points - but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted, and deserves all the praises that received. A movie that has to be seen at least once, and if you don't love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist!~10
The Shawshank Redemption~7 August 1998~NOT just a prison movie~A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont. . . Who? Starring Tim Robbins. . . Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck? I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie. Now the only questions I have to ask are: Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie? and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar? Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'. Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow. Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach. . . Perfect.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~12 December 2007~Shamelessly uplifting; a heartfelt classic~"It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time.Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning.It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple ""prison drama"", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free.-10/10"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~17 April 2011~Redemptive Masterpiece; Masterful Redemption~"Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why?I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that ""Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him."" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip ""The Letter Duet"" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: ""Music makes you free!""The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any ""corrupted decency."" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony..."" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: ""Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!"" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~6 October 2011~A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...~"I will never forget the first time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film ""with the poster"" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone ""The Godfather"" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly.This is the strength of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence.And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is ""The Shawshank Redemption""In the same vein than ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shawshank"" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : ""Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose."" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~11 October 2020~For hope, see it only.~My top film. Hope is good, and it never dies. 🌲🌲🌲? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 June 2020~Not that much good to get the rank 1~"After ten years, I watched this movie again. I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not, because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top. Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations. The best coutes: ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged."" - Red? "~8
The Shawshank Redemption~14 February 2013~For Everyone who Gave This Movie a 1~I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 May 2020~The best film of all time ?~"I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good. I guess Opinions differ and that's fine. For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was ""the highest rated film of all time"" unfortunately hurt my experience. I was expecting a lot more, which in the end I didn't get. But still a good watch nonetheless.? "~8
The Shawshank Redemption~17 May 2007~A favourite film~When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~5 April 2021~A movie to fuel one's life.~"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing.""said Andy.I've been told a couple of times this movie is a must-watch before I die. A movie with almost all actors, and in a prison, is a bit masculine to me. Yet I occasionally read it on Wikipedia and also saw that in Netflix by chance, I gave it a go.On the ground of some personal experience I could feel how Andy feels. This movie is about persisting faith of oneself and of life, even for those serving lifetime sentence.""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'"" is the best quote. If you are in search of a powerhouse movie, this would be the choice.I am from Hong Kong, I would also recommend ""The Greed of a Man"" (a Hong Kong drama) and ""Itaewon Class""( a South Korea drama). The male lead achieved their lifetime goal spending long enough time like Andy. We all know they are fictions, but so what? Just learn the message."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~12 May 1999~Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.~Truly a masterpiece of cinema. I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by. Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film. How did it not win oscars galore. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story. A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints. I LOVE THIS FILM!? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~17 September 2006~Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...~"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay."~7
The Shawshank Redemption~16 September 2010~Observations...~Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure~8
The Shawshank Redemption~10 December 2013~A Story Of Hope & Resilence~"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well."~9
The Shawshank Redemption~14 April 2016~Reputation notwithstanding, this is powerful stuff~"You could describe ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.And that cast is impeccable.9/? "~9
The Shawshank Redemption~30 November 2021~When And How Did The Movie Studios Forget How To Make Films Like This?~I am not black, not a crook, not a prisoner, not a Christian retarded warden and not from that period and yet i identify with these guys, their plight and their times.The story is entertaining, the characters interesting and the plot development anticipatory and fascinating.Makes me forget for 2 hours that I live in a period of remakes, sequels, gender switches, DCU, MCU and... GAG.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~7 October 2013~about freedom~a film about freedom. not only because the story has as scene a prison. but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director, ideas and dialogs, whole script and special emotions of viewer. it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script. it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship. it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception. it seems be perfect. and this is key to be more than a good/interesting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson. Red, Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne. that is all. at first sigh.? ~0
The Shawshank Redemption~7 October 2013~I can see why this is rated Number 1 on IMDb.~"Based on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on IMDb.A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely imprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and befriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The men's friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot puts it, ""solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long. However, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid, blending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong, dramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama, tragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review. Therefore, you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it. It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (Forrest Gump won that year). A must-see for anybody.Grade A"~10
The Shawshank Redemption~20 September 2015~One Of The Most Inspiring And Beautiful Movies Of All Time~"Greetings from Lithuania.It is very hard to call ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption.Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one the fainest examples."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~27 November 2015~The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made.~This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film.This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them.This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~10 December 2007~An amazing tale of hope and patience~When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~28 May 2014~Highly Overrated But Still Good~"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.? "~7
The Shawshank Redemption~19 May 2018~A timeless masterpiece. A heart wrenching drama. An epic tale of true friendship.~I had never heard about this film before. It was just one day while I was searching my local DVD store this year that I found a brand new, special two-disc collector's edition. The title attracted me, and as I browsed the internet before buying the disc, I was blown away by the response the film had got. I instantly brought the DVD, but sadly couldn't watch it for long. Today, I finally decided to watch it, and by the time it ended, all I had was the happiness of watching a heart wrenching drama and a smile on my face.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's a very old film, but no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna love it. This is a very emotional and inspiring prison drama which is worth watching by one and all despite of its content rating. Not only has the film been written and directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, it also has stellar performances coming from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Believe me, the two make the best buddies I've ever seen in a film till date.SR is a pure drama with some crime element thrown in. But it doesn't fail to impress and entertain you, and even surprises you before the time it ends. It makes sure that you get inspired and moved by the message it delivers with perfection. Another great thing: it has no romance to hinder the story. It's a heartwarming, effective and unforgettable character drama which makes you unable to get from your seat till the very end.Some think it's overrated, but honestly, it isn't. After all, this is a film which anyone who likes movies, especially dramas, can very easily appreciate. I just liked to see Tim and Morgan in a frame, because whenever they come together, there's something wonderful going to happen. The dialogues are brilliantly written: there are a lot of lines bound to be remembered forever.Technically too, the film shines. A film set within a prison could've been devoid of any visual excellence but the cinematographer has totally nailed it, providing us with the clear vision of what the director wanted us to see. Through this entire duration of 140 minutes, I felt a different range of emotions from sadness to happiness to even anger at times. It's that powerful.Saying anything more would sound like an understatement. Many others have already praised the film in their respective reviews, and I totally appreciate that. It's sad that such a great film wasn't a commercial success. But its real success lies in being the most memorable drama of all time. I really feel happy and lucky for having brought the DVD.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~6 August 1998~Very Cool!!!~"Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?? "~0
The Shawshank Redemption~7 March 2000~If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more~The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound. And he wasn't. This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws. These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results. I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong. A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind. Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great. It's a very good story very well told. Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ... Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role. (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.) Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can. Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well.~8
The Shawshank Redemption~30 January 2006~Incredibly moving, funny and haunting~Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~24 October 2006~really superb~"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time..? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~22 October 2019~Masterpiece.~The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~1 November 2020~The best movie i ever watched~Tye movie is just perfect. The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~10 February 2008~What a movie!!!~I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~24 August 2010~The best movie ever?~"Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time."~0
The Shawshank Redemption~3 July 2010~Best of all time!!!~This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~26 December 2011~One of the best - of all time. Seriously.~If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.~9
The Shawshank Redemption~26 December 1998~AN EXCELLENT MASTERPIECE !!~Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~14 June 2012~You'll get it when you see it.~A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~17 January 2005~A true story of friendship and hard times~Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10~10
The Shawshank Redemption~9 August 2012~best movie ever~this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyone.the story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guard.overall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film don't spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival 10/10 you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~8 December 2021~For When You Need to (Re)Watch A Good Movie~This is it.The film has it all. Superb actors, even better screenplay, fabulous redemptive conclusion and believe me when I insist with all of that said they did not forget the entertainment.Are there/will there ever be any other films like this?? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~7 May 2021~Perfect~I cannot think of one reason I would not give this 10/10 just out of principle. Otherwise, it is the perfect movie with an incredible story, acting and euphoric finale that nonetheless is not without tragedy in the meantime.I need to find the original story.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~16 March 2006~Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumph~The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.? ~9
The Shawshank Redemption~8 August 2015~Too flawed~This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.~3
The Shawshank Redemption~9 February 2006~First 10 I have ever given out~This is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says about Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the year.Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel (Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i think) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~2 July 2012~I thought I'd discovered this movie~"I'd never heard of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a ""sleeper,"" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Heat."" I didn't see ""Forrest Gump"" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose ""Shawshank"" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making ""Hey, it's not all that!"" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for ""The Big Lebowski,"" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like ""Rocky Horror"" once was. I saw ""Rocky Horror"" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~7 April 2022~A bit overhyped~Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.? ~7
The Shawshank Redemption~25 December 2003~Sometimes, we all just don't agree.~"Last week, I had seen ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big ""prison"" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with ""The Green Mile"" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's ""Oz"" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", I find myself here at ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing."~3
The Shawshank Redemption~11 January 2011~If you haven't seen this movie, stop everything and watch it right now~"Movies simply do not get better than this.Inspiring, captivating, intense, funny (at times), tragic (at times). Interesting and thrilling.Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting, story, dialog, production, setting, cinematography, etc... all perfect.This film is truly flawless.I could not describe this movie as ""fun"" but I would describe it is unparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense- just plain and simple it is story telling at its finest.If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely need to watch it right now. Fantastic. I wish I could give it a higher rating than 10 out of 10 stars."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~31 January 2006~A Masterpiece~"For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and ""redemption"" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things"". Gentle and supremely smart.? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~9 January 2006~One of my TOP TEN~"I saw (once again) last night ""Shawshank Redemption"". If I have seen it once, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time.""Shawshank"" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current ""human"" existence. I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival.This is a movie that NO ONE should miss."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~23 June 2020~Good movie - Number 1 ??? No way~I had been meaning to see this film since it is rated #1 on IMDb. It is a very good film and very well acted; however, no wayyyyyy is it the best film of all time. Morgan Freeman is particularly good as Red and the other actors perform very admirably, but I don't find the film overwhelmingly powerful. I've seen many many films that do more. I rate it a 7 out of 10.? ~6
The Shawshank Redemption~18 December 2003~Escape from Shawshank~"It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a worthy one.At the end of the day, ""Shawshank"" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration.That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film."~6
The Shawshank Redemption~16 March 2014~Breaking Big Rocks Into Little Rocks~"This Film has a Strange History. Nominated for Seven Oscars (winning none) the Movie was not a Box-Office Hit and Faded pretty much into Obscurity as an Arty Film with two Lead Actors Delivering Standard Good Work, but Nothing to get Excited about.But Something Happened that is Really Unexplainable. People got Excited about it. No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement, it just Happened. A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved Movies Ever. Managing to Steadily Climb to ""God-Like"" Status among Best of Lists and Fanatic Praise.It is a Fine Movie. A Throwback Movie. A more or less Standard Storytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous Misfortune. A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good. Nothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go. But what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the Long Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly.This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. it's just a Smooth, Entertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the Job Done."~8
The Shawshank Redemption~21 October 2008~Perfectly written. Perfectly directed. Perfectly cast. Perfectly acted. Perfect~I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it.The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen.The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.~10
The Shawshank Redemption~1 October 2005~Don't Watch This Movie!! (Unless you want to Cry)~I knew about this movie for a long time.Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative impression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film.If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.~10

The Shawshank Redemption~8 March 2001~A great film, but #2?~"A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, life's all about opinions..."~8
The Shawshank Redemption~29 August 1999~Morgan Freeman is the only great thing in this movie~Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.? ~3
The Shawshank Redemption~1 January 2006~My second favorite movie of all time~"Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say ""OMG, I love this story!"" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~13 November 2020~Greatness~This is the best movie I ever watched in my entire life.whenerver I feel sad or depressed I always watch this movie.it always gives me hope.Hope is a good thing.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~25 December 1998~Absolutely brilliant~The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~18 December 2007~Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction~"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs.

The Shawshank Redemption~9 February 2021~Undeservedly top 1~"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors. I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?? "~7
The Shawshank Redemption~10 August 1998~The greatest movie ever!~The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****~0
The Shawshank Redemption~24 October 2008~#2086~"Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and ""nasty-nice"" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term ""perfect piece of entertainment"" does not exaggerate."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~18 July 2021~Decided to give it a try and..~And i think it might be the best movie of all time.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~16 July 2013~Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy.~"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions.The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying.But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit."~10
The Shawshank Redemption~16 July 2013~Greatest movie of all time!~This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~6 December 1998~One word. Outstanding.~"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption.""? "~10
The Shawshank Redemption~3 September 2002~Overlong, Overblown and Over-rated~Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)It worries me that many of the comments here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature.~4
The Shawshank Redemption~20 July 2021~Best movie ever!!~Just watched it today....better late than sorry...amazing movie.? ~10
The Shawshank Redemption~2 November 1998~Why so high?~This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.? ~7
The Shawshank Redemption~6 August 1998~A prison drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.~My favorite movie ever. These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie. A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining. Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven). Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things. It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it. Tim Robbins is great in the lead. Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden. William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict. Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts. A must see.~10
The Godfather~1 April 2019~An offer so good, I couldn't refuse~"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."~10
The Godfather~6 February 2021~One of the best of all time.~A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.~10
The Godfather~11 February 2018~For Me, This Is The Definitive Film~This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/? ~10

The Godfather~30 March 2013~#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!~"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."~10
The Godfather~18 July 2010~I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was~There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox~10
The Godfather~1 April 2014~Everything you've ever heard is true...~THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.~10
The Godfather~16 May 2001~perfect~This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.683 out of 1,002 found this helpful.

The Godfather~8 May 2021~Why didn't I enjoy this as much I should've~I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.? ~7
The Godfather~9 March 2008~The Don And His Sons~"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played."~10
The Godfather~22 January 2020~Amazing movie~The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.~10
The Godfather~6 August 2006~A Masterpiece~This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!~10
The Godfather~9 March 2019~Simply the best~This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.? ~10
The Godfather~10 June 1999~The Godfather~Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.? ~10
The Godfather~4 July 2005~The world inside the underworld!~"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"~10
The Godfather~24 April 2005~"For me it isn't ""the greatest ever"", but it's still great"~"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."~10
The Godfather~18 October 2017~"""I'm Going To Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse"""~"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-"~9
The Godfather~20 December 2015~A genre-defining masterpiece~New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.An all-time classic.~10
The Godfather~28 November 2013~Truly the Godfather of movies~Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.~10
The Godfather~6 March 2016~Be sure to give it the respect it deserves.~The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.~10
The Godfather~15 September 2020~The godfather~The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it? ~10
The Godfather~30 March 2019~Perfection~Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.? ~10
The Godfather~27 February 2022~Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again, ever.~The Corleone family face a threat to their lives and business.This is one of the greatest movies of all time.I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.~10
The Godfather~24 March 2015~The Greatest Film of All Time ! Period.~"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."~10
The Godfather~26 February 2008~Truly a Masterpiece~"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."~10
The Godfather~24 November 2020~Good but overhyped~I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.~7
The Godfather~16 June 2010~What is there to say?~Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.~9
The Godfather~25 November 2002~Count Me In The Minority~"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10"~6
The Godfather~4 April 2002~Slightly overrated~"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10"~8
The Godfather~9 July 2006~This Movie Has Haunted My Life...~I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.? ~10
The Godfather~17 October 2015~Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice~"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic!

The Godfather~27 February 2019~How things were done back then!~The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.? ~10
The Godfather~22 April 2019~A masterpiece~"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."~10
The Godfather~20 July 2018~It is good~This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic.? ~10
The Godfather~9 February 2018~Regarded a classic for good reason, Coppola's crime epic is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.~Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10~9
The Godfather~13 June 2022~Not sure~"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.But i never get into it.The plot is ok but i wanted more.I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.They just ""looked"" and there was silence.I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself."~7
The Godfather~2 January 2013~"""He is a good godson."""~"This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"~8
The Godfather~29 April 2005~Oh, Those Corleones....~"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"~9
The Godfather~5 October 2010~"Allow ""The Godfather"" to make you an offer you can't refuse"~"""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."~9
The Godfather~15 July 2014~"""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."""~The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die.? ~10
The Godfather~9 September 2022~Dog Eat Dog...~It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.~7
The Godfather~19 January 2021~Classic~One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.A powerful and unforgettable film achievement.~10
The Godfather~20 December 2019~I don't get the hype.~I watched this recently because of all the hype. Maybe it is because of the hype I thought it was average or maybe it's just an average film.It is a good movie but it is a a little slow at times. The acting is very good and the plot solid but best movie ever? IMO not close.Goodfellas as a mob movie I enjoyed much more. Maybe because it's a more modern film I don't know?Worth a watch but don't get too excited.? ~5
The Godfather~4 October 2009~THE crime epic of the 20th century.~"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"~10
The Godfather~5 January 2016~Filmmaking At Its Most Perfect, Genuine, Complete, Crystalline & Pure.~Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended.~0
The Godfather~22 November 2010~a classic when first released; only improves with age~"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."~10
The Godfather~24 March 2004~Monumental Film-Making and Arguably the Greatest Movie Ever.~"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.? "~0
The Godfather~29 September 2008~A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus~The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/~10
The Godfather~29 January 2015~I Know I'm In The Minority.....~"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it.With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton.Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated"~8
The Godfather~15 January 2004~A little over rated, but I know good film making when I see it~"I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget ""The Godfather"".9/? "~9
The Godfather~14 October 2019~The Godfather~Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.~10
The Godfather~7 July 2013~No Movie is the Best Movie Ever~One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.~10
The Godfather~25 July 2005~The Greatest, no questions asked~"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie."~10
The Godfather~7 May 2015~The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art~"Greetings from Lithuania.To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."~10
The Godfather~17 November 2009~A view from the other side of life.~The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.~10
The Godfather~17 October 2018~It is great, but hardly the best~"I finally set out to take three hours to watch ""the best movie ever"" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.8/? "~8
The Godfather~2 August 1998~The best film in movie history~What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10.? ~10
The Godfather~30 November 2005~Has its moments, but not the best film~'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.? ~5
The Godfather~10 February 2022~Gangster classic~Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better.? ~7
The Godfather~10 October 2014~Such a freaking classic.~"Don Vito Corleone: ""You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?"".The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is.? "~10
The Godfather~5 May 2006~The Godfather is a good movie~I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.? ~10
The Godfather~28 October 2003~A work of art.~Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best. Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.~10
The Godfather~10 August 2022~The GODFATHER what else can i say ?~The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family).? ~10
The Godfather~30 September 2006~The best movie ever? Nah, an entertaining film? Yes.~I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.~9
The Godfather~14 October 2013~Perhaps the Greatest of All Time?~I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather.I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up!In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.~0

The Godfather~12 December 2004~Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.~"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan."~0
The Godfather~22 September 2020~Best Movie Of All Time~This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on. It's a must see for everyone.? ~10
The Godfather~6 November 2008~"I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Give ""The Godfather"" 10 stars."~"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever"~10
The Godfather~20 March 2015~The Pioneer of All Filmmaking~The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome.~10
The Godfather~27 December 2008~Mafia 101~The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.? ~10
The Godfather~6 March 2009~"""I believe in America"""~"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."~10
The Godfather~29 March 2022~ONE OF THE BEST EVER!~AL Pacino, Marlon Brando, I could go on all day but we would be here for 3 hours, and instead of that you could just see for yourselves how good this movie and actors are. Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 Timeless classic.? ~10
The Godfather~7 March 2017~In the dictionary under masterpiece~"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.This is an epic in every sense of the word.9/? "~9
The Godfather~15 March 2015~The best movie by far.~So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.~10
The Godfather~21 October 2019~The film of films~A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.? ~10
The Godfather~19 February 2000~an obvious word: masterpiece~"The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well."~10
The Godfather~4 October 2008~This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.~The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.~10
The Godfather~16 December 2018~What?~How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie.

The Godfather~4 January 2009~Brando Rex ! Godfather Marathon  28/12/08  13H30 (Screen)~"The Godfather Trilogy was projected on one single day at the Paris cinematheque: 9 hours of film and 9 hours of pure delight!I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the sameBrando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root!What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!"~10

The Godfather~11 May 2009~"with its long, but taut running time, perfect casting, and all under the control of Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" easily scores as one of the best films ever made"~"When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come."~10
The Godfather~14 August 2003~VERY good, but not the best...~"...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic. It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties. It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny. Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it. He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom. Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama. Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama. ""Casablanca"" is the best romance. ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures. All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics. Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining. Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10."~10
The Godfather~25 July 2021~"""Don't ever take sides against the family again."""~"Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.What's indicative of how powerful ""The Godfather"" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.Followed by two sequels, ""The Godfather"" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.10 out of 10."~10
The Godfather~31 August 2013~Timeless Mafia Film.~Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.A masterpiece.? ~10
The Godfather~6 August 2018~Overrated? Maybe a little bit.~Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.? ~8
The Godfather~2 March 2009~Great But Overrated Movie!~"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10."~8
The Godfather~22 December 2008~Cinematic Classic~The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola)Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)? ~10
The Godfather~19 March 2010~Brando's aged make-up is incredible~Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.? ~0
The Godfather~10 February 2006~Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.~"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one."~7
The Godfather~26 November 2009~Showy and shallow~"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."~6
The Godfather~1 October 2018~ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.~My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.~10
The Godfather~30 March 2014~One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.~The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.~10
The Godfather~6 December 2015~One of the greats, if not the great.~There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix.The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.~10
The Godfather~1 September 2018~Great movie~Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic.? ~10
The Godfather~13 May 2005~Truly masterly film-making, right up there with Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List~STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.)What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****~10
The Godfather~23 September 2013~Very Average Film. Very Overrated~Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.? ~7
The Godfather~4 February 2006~Best film ever made~As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10~10
The Godfather~9 November 2020~This movie is a masterpiece in pratically every way.~The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece.Every performance, every shot, every set, every choice made in this movie leads to a masterpiece of an experience. A wholly engrossing film that pulls you into its world, its characters and its settings and drenches you in its warm and lively atmosphere.? ~10
The Godfather~23 February 2019~Never Fails~I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best.? ~10
The Godfather~29 November 2000~IT'S JUST TOO LONG~"""The Godfather"" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)? "~9
The Godfather~27 December 2005~"""Perfection..."""~The Godfather (1972)Number 1 - 1972Number 1 - 1970sTop 5 - All TimeAn offer you can't refuse ...The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances everFrancis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:'The best gangster film since The Godfather'Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them.Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.-10/10-~10
The Godfather~28 October 2000~A bit long, but at least there's quality as well as quantity~Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone. It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational. There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history. The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight. The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is. Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest. While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.~9
The Godfather~8 July 2015~Epic Gangster Movie!!!~"""The Godfather"" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.The Direction done by ""Francis D Coppola"" is great and the acting done by ""Al Pacino"" and others were 100% Top notch.I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!? "~10
The Godfather~9 October 2005~A novel of images~"Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular."~9
The Godfather~4 February 2013~And so it begins~"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)"~10
The Godfather~3 March 2016~America's Masterpiece~"Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it."~10
The Godfather~2 June 2002~The best!~"I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself. Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time. Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character. Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect. After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3. Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!? "~10

The Godfather~30 September 2015~A True Classic~"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot? "~10
The Godfather~13 February 2015~Great movies are not born great, they are made great.~"I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."~10
The Godfather~13 January 2022~Would Watch Once~G: i personally would say 8 out of 10 but the movie does drag on which is why i have to rate it a bit lower C: Heard too much about movie so expectations were set too high, disappointed seemed over-hyped. 7 out of 10.? ~7
The Godfather~31 March 2022~One of the Best Movies Ever Made~This film has an amazing everything. Amazing acting. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing writing. This movie I could re watch hundreds of times and it would never get old. It's too good!? ~9
The Godfather~1 November 2015~Marlon Brando at his best!~Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it.But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.~10
The Godfather~20 August 2020~Excellent~Terrific trip into the world of the Corleone's! Enjoyed all 3 hours!? ~9
The Godfather~24 April 2015~The definitive mob movie~Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.~10
The Godfather~16 April 2021~Excellent for its time, but doesn't hold the test of time.~I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years.~5
The Godfather~14 January 2021~Definitely not a masterpece~"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion. The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition. But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive... Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion.? "~7
The Godfather~22 June 2002~"List of things which are more entertaining than watching ""The Godfather"""~"1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons, great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive."~3
The Godfather~8 January 2015~Let's Get Down To The Facts~"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.? "~3
The Godfather~5 September 2005~Agonising, overrated, what's all the fuss about?~"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."~4
The Godfather~18 June 2004~Its good but Geez....~"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored. At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense.I've seen it again recently, twice. I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good. But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice. He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk. James Caan is miscast. Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing. Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too.? "~7
The Godfather~3 August 2015~It never gets old!~"This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for ""The Godfather"". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim!Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie?This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!? "~10
The Godfather~21 August 1999~An overrated classic.~Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable.? ~7
The Godfather~26 February 2019~The greatest film of all time.~The power of cinema at its purest and most vivid expression. Screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, editing, it all comes in the most elevated form. Francis Ford Coppola is a craftsman, as every director and artist should be, that draws inspiration from the power of the words and of the actions of characters and provides the standard upon which all the following history of cinema relies. It's an historic work of art.? ~10
The Godfather~31 July 2003~Not great, merely very well made~The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way.? ~5
The Godfather~16 May 2015~Masterpiece~No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie.? ~10
The Godfather~14 June 2015~Why all the fuss~Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?? ~4
The Godfather~14 April 2023~Nothing good about this movie~One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It felt like a Lifetime movie except for the angry wife seeking revenge it is angry men seeking revenge. The movie starts out with no back story to introduce the characters, who they are, where they are in life and a why to it all while introducing their goals or life plans. As the story progresses the characters do not grow as humans and develop more depth, to the contrary they go in the opposite direction they become less mature and even less human. They lose any depth they had and seem to be motivated entirely by revenge and greed. It is not an antihero story where the main character's motives and means is questionable but ultimately relatable and you feel if you were in the position you might or at least would be tempted to do the same, it's more of a childish jerk story where they seem to be very childish meaning impulsive, over reacting and not thought out well in terms of long term consequences. It is an incredibly slow moving movie and I just finished the movie not a full 15 minutes ago and if you were to show me a picture of a character and ask me who it is, I don't think I could tell you because the writing is so sloppy that you don't build a connection with the characters that make you care about what happens to them, as I was watching the film I was hoping for murders because it would have added some action to an incredibly slow film and because it would mean the end was nearing.~1
The Godfather~7 July 2006~The Godawfulfather~"This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this ""movie"". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10.? "~1
The Godfather~4 November 2022~Overrated, but still good~I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.? ~7
The Godfather~8 June 2022~Never understood the hype~"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much.? "~5
The Godfather~10 September 2020~a great work for art~A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble. A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)? ~9
The Godfather~18 August 2015~Couldn't get any better than this...~"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!"~10
The Godfather~2 October 2002~Great film making in a moral vacuum.~"A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery.We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate? The bricks and mortar of the Long Island mansion that we see before us.The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims..."~9
The Dark Knight~12 February 2020~The Dark Knight~Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.? ~0
The Dark Knight~24 July 2008~A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions~"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!? "~9
The Dark Knight~17 February 2021~This town deserves a better class of criminal!~This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!? ~10
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~Heath Ledger's Dark and Brilliant Swan Song~"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.? "~10
The Dark Knight~7 October 2019~MASTERPIECE~It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs.? ~10
The Dark Knight~7 July 2008~"Surpasses ""Begins"" in every aspect!!!"~"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."~10
The Dark Knight~14 September 2008~Watch the IMAX version if you can~"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"~10
The Dark Knight~22 January 2021~Heath Ledger~If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.Rest in peace Heath Ledger.? ~9
The Dark Knight~9 December 2020~Christopher Nolan back at it again.~What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.Overall rating: 9.4.? ~9
The Dark Knight~1 November 2013~Heath Ledger makes this great~Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.? ~9
The Dark Knight~16 July 2008~The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted~"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."~10
The Dark Knight~16 January 2021~Best in it's class and much more~This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best.? ~10
The Dark Knight~16 July 2008~Heath Ledger is a ledgend!~Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!~10
The Dark Knight~24 November 2019~Mindblowing~I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time.? ~10
The Dark Knight~14 January 2021~9.4 Top Contender for 'Best Superhero Movie'~*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past.

The Dark Knight~12 January 2021~Perfect combo~Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......? ~10
The Dark Knight~24 July 2008~Amazing non-stop action and eye-popping skyscraper scenes!~I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.~9
The Dark Knight~10 April 2023~Knock, Knock...~There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground.? ~8
The Dark Knight~11 August 2020~Good but overrated~This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through.? ~7
The Dark Knight~14 January 2022~Entertaining, but not a masterpiece~"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.? "~7
The Dark Knight~9 July 2008~Film surpasses the hype~We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.~10
The Dark Knight~24 April 2020~What a movie!!~Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best? ~10
The Dark Knight~6 January 2023~Quite an astonishing movie.~A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.Superior to pretty much everything else.10/10.~10
The Dark Knight~15 January 2021~One of the best movies~"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.? "~10
The Dark Knight~19 January 2021~Best movie ever~The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life? ~10
The Dark Knight~17 June 2019~Really good but not as 4th best movie of all time. That's just clear.~"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5.? "~8
The Dark Knight~11 January 2012~Fantastic!~Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen? ~10
The Dark Knight~8 October 2019~The best comic book movie in existence~There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.? ~10
The Dark Knight~5 August 2008~About as Perfect as a Batman Film Could Ever Be~"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."~9
The Dark Knight~9 January 2021~Good luck to anyone who wants to create a Batman movie ever again...~The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch.? ~9
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~Good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazingly perfect in every possible way on an epic scale of perfection? No.~"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs*The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."~8
The Dark Knight~3 April 2010~Very well made, moody and gripping with a brilliant Heath Ledger, if a tad bloated~I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox~8

The Dark Knight~15 January 2012~One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!~I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.? ~10
The Dark Knight~16 May 2017~Mind Blowing~I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10.~10
The Dark Knight~19 October 2020~The Dark Knight~Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger? ~8
The Dark Knight~31 December 2008~Sometimes the Truth is not Good Enough~"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"~9
The Dark Knight~25 July 2008~Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.~"Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down."~6
The Dark Knight~22 February 2009~Wow - Mind Blowing Action~"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."~10
The Dark Knight~17 August 2008~Bat-A-Man!~There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!~10
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie~Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.~6
The Dark Knight~15 January 2021~By far the BEST Batman movie .~I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie.? ~10
The Dark Knight~12 January 2009~I've Gone Batty!~This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.? ~9
The Dark Knight~21 February 2013~Weird, sadistic, no redeeming value, really~"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10"~3
The Dark Knight~7 July 2008~Best movie of 2008 hands down!~"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"~10
The Dark Knight~14 March 2020~Overrated... That's All I Can Say~I really do not get why this movie was so sensational and why The Joker character was so attractive. The Joker contradicts himself in many ways. He said he is not a monster, but he is. I understand he is a chaotic evil and anarchist, so people are drawn for that; however, is it really enough justification for Joker to destroy the whole city? His explanation for wrongdoing everytime he does sounds like excuse. Just blow it. Don't explain it. That's way more attractive emphasizing his 'freak'ness and chaos. He says he's not the one with the plan, just reacting to the ones fallen to him by the good side. Gosh, is it really true? He made the plans so complicated and well-organized that his mission was all success to the level of perfection. Even when the good side thinks they win, Perfect All Mighty Joker comes in and sweeps in. I think the director deliberately made the Joker look more powerful, shrewd, and omnipotent to blur the line between the good and the evil. However, Batman and Gordon deserve much more because the real good pretending to be evil can be a great storyline as well. To me, it was high quality movie with director's well-planned scenario but nothing more than that. I cannot call it a masterpiece as many critics do.~7
The Dark Knight~9 January 2010~Noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design~Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average.~8
The Dark Knight~12 September 2021~Great but overrated~This movie is great but not one of the best ever it's really overrated imo.With Ledger's Joker this wouldn't be as greatly reviewed as it is.? ~8
The Dark Knight~19 July 2008~"""The Dark Knight"" finally realizes the full potential of the Batman mythology"~"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."~0
The Dark Knight~25 July 2008~Very Good, But Yikes, Let's Keep Things in Perspective~"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""Grade: A"~8
The Dark Knight~14 February 2022~Doesn't live up to the hype~It's a good flick but it tries too hard and doesn't live up to the hype. One of the highest ranked movies on IMDb. I don't think it's quite that good.? ~7
The Dark Knight~11 October 2015~The best epic Science Fiction/Action film, The Dark Knight is Nolan's masterpiece.~"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!The Dark Knight score: A + .

The Dark Knight~19 October 2020~The Dark Knight~An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker? ~8
The Dark Knight~17 January 2021~The most spectacular out of dark knight trilogy~Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !? ~10
The Dark Knight~22 July 2008~The Noir Card~"Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from ""graphic novel"" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film.That's as opposed to ""Sin City,"" which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard.The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is ""writing"" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know ""Prestige"" and ""Memento,"" even ""Following,"" you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why ""Clockwork Orange"" is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."~0
The Dark Knight~16 June 2009~not as good as all the hype~I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.~7
The Dark Knight~15 July 2008~If you only see one movie this summer yada yada yada...~"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."~10
The Dark Knight~24 April 2009~Distinctly average and surprisingly rather dull~It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.~5
The Dark Knight~30 July 2008~Does What it Set Out To Do~Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.~9
The Dark Knight~24 February 2021~Honestly the worst of the Batman movies~"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass.? "~3
The Dark Knight~16 December 2008~Too long...I just wanted it to end~"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum."~6
The Dark Knight~10 November 2020~Overrated~"Yeah, it sucks to add another movie to the list of things everyone else likes but me, but here we are. I have, however, heard some of the people who raved about this movie when it came out since retract their comments and say it wasn't as good as they remembered, though I don't know if they were as underwhelmed the second time as I was.The first time I watched this movie I just didn't really get it, but I resolved to watch it again, knowing from its stellar reception that I must have missed something. Well, I finally gave it another go, after watching ""The Dark Knight Rises"", and I don't think there was anything to miss. There's a lot going on in this movie, though nothing I really cared about. As with ""Rises"", Batman is hardly in it, but that feels like a good thing because his raspy voice is stupid, as is the way he looks in his costume.Is Heath Ledger's Joker the most praised performance in the history of cinema? I wasn't around for Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" or Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but people were raving about Joker as though he invented acting with his characterisation. Hard for that not to be a let-down, though the performance is memorable, recalling less a super-villain than someone like Hannibal Lecter.The movie has few, if any, memorable scenes, and not much about it makes sense. The fact that all you ever heard about it was about Ledger's performance might lead to surprise when you find out that Two-Face was also in it, but he is.I wish I knew why this was supposed to be so great."~6
The Dark Knight~4 August 2008~for me,it doesn't even touch Batman Begins~i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10.? ~5
The Dark Knight~17 July 2008~Why so serious, right?~"""The Dark Knight"" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor ""Batman Begins"". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline.It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: ""You complete me"". That phrase reminded me of the great movie ""Unbreakable"" is.But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design.""It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you"", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in ""Batman Begins"". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart).Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" treats to the viewer.Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town ""deserves a better kind of criminal""-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose.Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in ""Batman Begins"". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in ""Batman Begins"", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but ""The Dark Knight"" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?"~8
The Dark Knight~6 February 2021~The Dark Knight Movie Review~Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!? ~10
The Dark Knight~28 June 2023~Why so serious?~First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.To quote a certain character: Why so serious?~7
The Dark Knight~3 May 2009~Dark and Dreary~"Although an average film, ""Batman Begins"" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make ""Batman Ends.""? "~4
The Dark Knight~6 May 2015~A Modern Masterpiece~A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience.? ~10
The Dark Knight~23 March 2020~Overhyped & overlong !!!~One of the overhyped movies for me. It was slow boring annoying at some scenes, and unnecessarily overlong, I felt like they wanted to stuff it with stories & elements more than it should !!!It was hard for me to follow & to stay focused all along with the plot, I had to stop the movie several times to play with my phone, & check when will it be finished.I gave this movie 5 for its visuals and for heath ledger's good performance of joker.? ~5
The Dark Knight~21 February 2021~You will not breathe while watching.~This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!? ~10
The Dark Knight~7 September 2012~Too Dark.~"I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face.I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.Grade D+"~5
The Dark Knight~18 July 2008~The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.~A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.~9
The Dark Knight~26 July 2008~Self-important, over-dramatic, uninspired.~It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama?I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment?Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results. Go figure.~6
The Dark Knight~26 March 2011~Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made!~"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.It's cool It's original It's awesomeI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"~10
The Dark Knight~13 August 2008~Critic and crowd pleaser raucously uninspiring~"Back to the movie, clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining. I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger, which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod; the writers give him some clever lines... like the ""you complete me"" phrase in the above quote (from Jerry MaGuire). But you know what I'm not buying? I'm not buying that this Batman flick, because of it's dark humor, is better than other comic-book-inspired movies; aside from the rare Joker line, nothing in this movie is humorous, dark or otherwise. In fact it's uncommonly depressing. I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films, in which we're to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a post-pubescent boy who has been given superhuman powers.My friends, these are movies (and movie advocates) that take themselves way too seriously....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008"~4
The Dark Knight~14 August 2008~Over hyped~I think those media representatives from the film company can pat themselves on the back for the job they've done with the Dark Knight. The hype surrounding the film has been fever pitch for several months. The furore on IMDb to get the film to be number 1 is a prime example.This is the second instalment of the latest Batman franchise. The sad death of Heath Ledger has led to a clamour for an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. Whilst it may be the best acting performance of the film I personally think his previous work was much more rounded and deserving of Oscar recognition.The Dark Knight is a classic summer blockbuster ... all action, but not quite enough substance. I personally enjoyed the first instalment more, as this focused rather more on Bruce Wayne. It seems his Batman really needs to go and see the doctor this time because that voice sounds very bad.It would have been a much better film if one of the set pieces was dropped in place of adding some depth to the characters, but I'm sure a lot of the people who loved the film would violently disagree on that point. This is definitely a film for the adrenalin junkies.~5
The Dark Knight~18 July 2008~A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike~"Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. ""The Dark Knight"" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against ""The Dark Knight."" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman."~10
The Dark Knight~19 August 2008~The Dark Knight~The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clichés and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.~10
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~Heath Ledger makes you forget Jack ever played Joker!~"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."~10
The Dark Knight~2 October 2010~The Most Overrated film I've ever seen!~When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.~6
The Dark Knight~4 September 2021~Overrated~Not that great. Didn't remain consistent with Batman Begins and was extremely predictable. The plot and action labors along and never reaches a satisfying conclusion. The best thing about this film is the score.? ~4
The Dark Knight~8 August 2008~Not bad, but not great. This is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies.~Is it finally over? Did the movie finally end? This movie proves the following: NEVER make a movie with comic book characters that is longer than two hours. Even most Shakespearean plays aren't that long. NEVER make a movie that is somber, morose and convoluted. NEVER have the good guy act like a bad guy (here Batman is just as nasty as the guys he's going after). NEVER have the leading lady play a support role. NEVER have lead actors play support roles unless they are no longer leading actors (superstars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are in support roles). NEVER have Batman without Robin. Christian Bale is no Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is no Neil Hamilton. This movie needed ... cried out for ... Batwoman (remember Julie Newmar?) ... and Frank Gorshin, Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero, and, yes, even Burt Ward and Adam West. This pretentious movie is not bad but it certainly is not great. The one bright spot in this otherwise somber production is the performance by the late Heath Ledger. His performance as the Joker almost carries this otherwise lackluster version of the Batman story. Batman is a hero and to portray him as being anything else does not work. Dark Knight is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies - long, pretentious, drawn out, somber, and above all, dull.A few words about Heath Ledger. Mr. Ledger was a great actor and proved it in Dark Knight. Despite the movie's flaws, his performance is practically flawless as he brings a unique interpretation of a sinister and complex character to the screen. Whenever Mr. Ledger was in a scene, the movie improved and became interesting. Mr. Ledger gave a great performance for which he deserves a BRAVO!Also, during the filming of Dark Knight, one of the stunt men, Conway Wickcliffe also passed away. Although not a movie star, the loss of Mr. Wickcliffe should be duly noted. From the extra in the crowd to the featured star, every member of the cast and crew play a critical role in bringing a story to the screen ... or the stage. The amount of planning and work involved in producing a movie or staging a play is almost indescribable and without the efforts of EVERY member of the cast and crew, the entertainment brought to public in the movie houses and theaters would not be possible.This movie reportedly is a box office smash hit, but when viewed today the theater was practically empty and after watching this movie, now I know why. After all, if you want to take a nap why pay good money to fall asleep while watching the Dark Knight?~7
The Dark Knight~29 July 2012~The film that the word 'overrated' was invented for.~8.9 out of 10—really? The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.~5
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~Bringing this conversation back down to earth~Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.~8
The Dark Knight~15 July 2008~This Movie Can Only Be Described With One Word.~"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."~10
The Dark Knight~3 May 2021~Basic~Some good elements and some I thought were kind of bad. Certainly not deserving of a 9/10 on IMDB.Acting was good but there's just something missing about this movie.? ~5
The Dark Knight~21 July 2008~good but overrated~I wanted to love this film. I hoped it would live up to the hype. I feel it does not. It is a solid film, ambitious and serious. Maybe too serious. Most of it are chaotic chases and fights or serious, somber talk about politics and commitment. Almost entire film is in the urban dark surroundings, literally dark, which is a lot to take in a very long movie. And too much Republican agenda for my liking, characters say it has to be worse before it gets better, u should endure a period of unpopularity, u stand for more important things than the public image, there are guys who do not follow logic, they just want to see the world burn, vigilantism is a price of freedom etc. One might think this Batman is, ehm, George W., Joker is Bin Laden and Gotham is America. Too much in a film about a guy in a plastic suit with two protruding ears who can fly, chasing a megalomaniac made up like a clown. A maniac that defies realism too, being able to be in many places at will, move around secretly tons of explosives etc. For a movie that takes itself that serious the transition of Dent into TwoFace is simplistic and shallow. Of course he fails to shoot the little blond boy because Batman intervenes at the last moment. It was a scene like from Peter Pan movie. And Batman has to beat Joker up to get the whereabouts of kidnapped Dent and his girlfriend but on two other occasions he knows where Dent is, just to intervene in time. For me the music was the only stand out, on its own keeping the adrenaline up.~7
The Dark Knight~26 September 2019~The Dark Knight is a rarity in Hollywood~The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it.~9
The Dark Knight~12 January 2009~Oh, come on, people, this is not one of the 250 great movies of all time~I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.~6
The Dark Knight~10 September 2008~If this is as great as everyone tells me, why do so many people agree with my criticisms!~"Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of ""The Killing Joke"" or the Joker of ""The Dark Knight"", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent.Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy ""Jurassic Park"" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings.Disappointing."~4
The Dark Knight~24 July 2008~Did you people see the same film I saw?~Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?~7
The Dark Knight~19 July 2008~Ledgers good, but he's no Jack~I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one. I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best. Sorry Heath, have fun in Heaven though.? ~0
The Dark Knight~31 July 2008~Way Overrated.~The buzz from the entire media, and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars. Well it wasn't. A matter of fact, this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years. Where to begin. Lets start with the so called great acting. You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line. Any way you analyze this movie. Its just plain old bad.? ~0
The Dark Knight~14 January 2009~Overrated and Two Face has no face~This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face.? ~7
The Dark Knight~8 February 2021~Best movie ever~Keep the rating above 9. This film is amazing. Not only one of the best comic book movies but one of best movies in the world.? ~10
The Dark Knight~22 March 2010~Ledger sublime, film over-plotted~"This was a pretty good film. The production quality was magnificent and Ledger's performance as the joker was magnificent.Overall, it opened strongly and for the most part, it was an engaging film with plenty of action and plot twists. However, there was something a bit ""overdone"" about the film. As another reviewer said, the ending felt as if it was built on as it was not born out of the main storyline.Second, there were too many sub-plots that distracted from the over-arching plot of the film. Similarly, there were abnormalities and things we feel are important seem to drop in and out of the storyline.Was Wayne still in love with Rachel? Was she still in love with him? Why did this fade in and out of importance? Was the joker trying to catch the batman for a share of the crime syndicate's money? Yes, no, but yes.... but ultimately no. Is Batman retiring? Yes!.... no! But why would he? Seemed the reason given was vague and confusing.What happened to the Lau? The crooked accountant snatched out of Hong Kong? The transformation of Dent's character was a bit odd and the dialogue at the end about Batman being the ""dark knight"" was a bit dumb! I did like it, but the screenplay and plotting was overdone and not enough focus was given to the primary plots. So in the end, it came off a bit scrambled. Excellent performances all round, I must say."~6
The Dark Knight~20 July 2008~A Sign of Hope~"Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way.The acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual ""superhero"" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he ""The Batman"" himself has to question his own morality.The best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words.Aaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie.The writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought ""oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one"". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit.I am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film.Now what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies."~10
The Dark Knight~19 July 2008~Better than Begins~Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.~8
The Dark Knight~18 September 2010~Dark Nought~I rented this movie to see Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance. I endured about an hour of this dreck, and, finding nothing compelling in Ledger's work (or anyone else's), turned it off before my mind turned to jelly. Admittedly, the film is well-produced, if somewhat dark and foreboding. I would have continued watching if the film was less stilted, and took itself a bit less seriously, campy and ridiculous as the material intrinsically is. But it does not go for laughs, and therefore becomes laughable.I found Christian Bale annoying, as usual, and was surprised at just how annoying Maggie Gyllenhaal (with whom I was not familiar) came across. One word kept pummeling my consciousness as I watched: STUPID! But I guess these kinds of flicks thrive on stupid. So, despite the big budget, big names, expensive CGI, positive reviews, and all-around high production values, there is still no remedy for stupid.Miss it and save your brain cells.~3
The Dark Knight~3 August 2008~The Joke's On Us~...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.In sum...About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that...~7
The Dark Knight~16 January 2009~A Matter of Perspective~I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.~3
The Dark Knight~18 July 2008~A-maz-ing~I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!~10
The Dark Knight~17 December 2008~Nolan's peak - as astonishing as people say.~"I've just re-watched 'The Dark Knight' on Blu-Ray at home, and before pressing play I was curious if whether I would find it as brilliant as back in the cinemas. Chris Nolan's masterpiece didn't need 10 seconds before I remembered all the stuff I loved about it. The opening Batman-logo sets the atmosphere to a dark, twisted and ghoulish film that's got more character-complexity and emotional depth than any other superhero-movie before it - then again, 'The Dark Knight' isn't really a superhero-movie, it doesn't deserve being compared to the likes of Fantastic Four, Iron Man or that ""incredible"" hulk. This is a crime-epic that shows both sides of right and wrong, it's an action-paced story featuring plot-twists that gives that twirled experience of Nolan's earlier movies, like Memento or the Prestige - always capable of doing the unexpected.The performances is an ensemble of great actors, and off course, I have to give Heath Ledger all the glory he deserves for turning the Joker character into something so frightening, compelling and dark that it's instantly one of the all-time-high villains in cinema history.'The Dark Knight' is simply a great, great crime-movie that showcases Nolan as truly one of the most brilliant directors around; this is his masterpiece as Soderbergh's 'Traffic', or P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'. Hopefully, the Academy Awards will see just how great a movie this is - it's not just a knock-out punch in cinema entertainment, but it's as muscular and arty as any action movie made to date."~7
The Dark Knight~2 April 2021~I never get tired of revisiting it~I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out.~10
The Dark Knight~28 September 2009~a good attempt but no cigar~I noticed that a film I had not seen was riding high in the IMDb chart and being intrigued I bought my copy of The Dark Knight. I was fairly impressed with the special effects and the acting from the cast was good and it was clear that a certain amount of care, effort and attention had been put into the films production. Ultimately though I felt as if it was a case of a fairly good attempt but no cigar. The film could have been a classic but it simply isn't good enough. Personally I was glad I had watched it but will not be rushing to watch it again and its current position in the IMDb chart is way above where it should be. It is also clear that the film has numerous enthusiastic supporters and having watched the film I can see why. I think there are a lot of people out there who have got carried away with all the hype, marketing and advertising and also I think it may be a case of its cool to say how good it is and agree with the majority. Lets just see in say five years where this film figures in the various charts that are out there. This film is not bad but its not very good either. I am not in the slightest bit bothered about swimming against the tide where this film or any other film is concerned, if its not very good I will say so but what the hey as I have said before opinion is all and I would recommend that anybody watch it at least once.~4
The Dark Knight~1 October 2019~Amazing!~Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.? ~10
The Dark Knight~1 May 2011~"""Why so serious?"" I couldn't agree more"~"Let me start off by saying that I hated this film. However, I'm giving it a fair rating anyway. As an avid comic-book fan, I've had the pleasure of seeing almost all of the comic book adaptations that have seen the light of the day (so far). And almost all of the films have been at least a worthwhile trip. Ironically, the highest rated comic book adaptation of all time, the film I'm reviewing right now, is pretty damn far down on that list. Everything that Burton did right in ""Batman"", Nolan did wrong in ""TDK"". TDK takes itself way too serious. I think Nolan missed the point of ""comic""-book. Comic, as in, amusement and entertainment. TDK is neither. It tries so hard to be a smart crime film, but to me it's just a bloody mess. The hero-villain confrontations simply falls flat, like a gum that lost it's flavor.Then there was the action sequences, which was entertaining enough to watch. But you know there's something wrong with the movie when you're only enthralled by the action sequences. The car chase sequence felt totally out of place, reminded me more of a trailer for a Fast and the Furious reboot. Then there was the cell phone gag, which felt totally out of place as well. ""Gotham City"" in TDK did nothing to me. There was nothing Gothic about it. Just an ordinary Hollywood city. Burton's portrayal of Gotham City in ""Batman"" was simply priceless. The atmosphere was just so good, the cinematography and editing were spot on. His Gothic approach to this kind of material is probably the best ever, the only film coming close is Sin City. Burton did it all on a $48 million budget. Nolan had a $185 million budget and he failed to accomplish this task. Sadly, he didn't learn anything from his mistakes in Batman Begins, but I guess that didn't stop people from funding him.Early Batman films were so fun to watch, and the actors that portrayed the villains, such as Jim Carrey, Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones, had such a great time, and it showed. Let's discuss the actor portraying the Joker who people praised to the skies: Heath Ledger. I completely fail to see how his performance could have been better than Nicholson, let alone equally good. Some say they were in the same league. Some say that the late Ledger was better by far. But good 'ol Nicholson will always be the true Joker to me. His portrayal of the Joker is probably one of the most accurately portrayed comic-book villains translated to the big screen, ever (some plot lines regarding the Joker was changed but Burton kept the character pure and original). Every single movement he made reflected something of his character. Heath Ledger's Joker was just a mad dog, as stated so many times during the film. Nothing more. His motives are unknown. In the original film, we are fully aware of the Joker's motives, and through flashbacks, we learn how he became such a gruesome monster. He's so fun to watch, not to mention that he actually laughs. Heath Ledger never even smirks (wait, a Joker that doesn't even laugh?) He doesn't pull any rabbits out of his hat like Nicholson. He just blows things up. He's just a sadistic nihilist and not a complex, unpredictable villain formerly known as Jack Napier. I hated how Nolan changed this character completely, if it was at least half as accurate as the original Joker, it might had been more interesting.Two-Face was an OK villain, but suffers from the same faults that the Joker had: he doesn't have any real motives! At least Tommy Lee Jones was fun to watch. We're never let into his head; at one point he is the good guy, and at the next he's the new villain. Why? The relationship between Rachel and Two-Face was laughable, the fact that he wanted to die for her was ridiculous. The fact that he wanted to blame everyone for Rachel's death, and use ""chance"" as an excuse for killing people was laughable. I wanted to know what happened in between. The characters in this film are simply not developed enough, which makes them boring and uninteresting. This problem wouldn't be as big if the movie didn't solely rely on (failed) tension and atmosphere. Without adding a pinch of entertainment, which is what a true comic book adaptation should include, the movie falls flat. And it doesn't have to be ha-ha entertainment, Sin City had both atmosphere and action, and succeeded at both; The Dark Knight had failed atmosphere and little action. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all provide great screen presence, as always. And then there's Christian Bale, an otherwise excellent actor, who lost a lot of credibility to me after taking on the role of ""Batman"". What an awful choice. What a cringe-worthy performance. Keaton is without a doubt, the best Batman so far, while the rest are circus clowns compared to him.As a final conclusion, I cannot recommend this film. Lacking elements that a real comic book adaptation should have, such as visual effects and accurately portrayed villains that are actually interesting to watch, the only redeeming values are some of the actors who did an OK job, and a few of the action scenes, notably the sequence at the beginning. Christopher Nolan is a great director, who still manages to show his skills in this film, but sadly, the benefits are for naught. The film succeeds a few times at creating, stylish, tension scenes, but those few tense scenes are far from enough from what this film could have (and should) have been. ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge disappointment to me, and should have been a huge improvement upon Batman Begins. I'm glad I didn't see this film with high expectations.Moose finds this film worthy of a 7."~5
The Dark Knight~4 March 2022~Just rewatched the full film as an adult, since i was a kid~This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH.? ~10
The Dark Knight~24 August 2008~Dark Screen (finally)~"This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. ""Two Face"" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie."~6
The Dark Knight~23 March 2009~My, oh my...~"This is starting to be downright ludicrous. Another naked king makes it to the top of the charts, helped by massive publicity.This is just another generic action blockbuster, based on tired clichés. It's not different from, say, those old Schwartzenegger movies: it's just updated for current trends and mass appeal: more effects, more speed, more violence, more noise, more music, just more of everything (except the intelligent stuff of course).The whole thing takes itself so seriously, and even pretends to bring some, er.. philosophical insight (sic) to the mix. Yeah, right. You end with a product that is not only mediocre, but aggressively and arrogantly so at that!Yes, Ledger's acting is a treat. And there's even a ~30 sec. good scene halfway through the movie. Er... That's about it.""Overrated'"" doesn't even start describing the irrational hype around this formulaic and forgettable action flick for teenagers."~4
The Dark Knight~25 July 2008~The Dark Hype~So much has been said on the latest instalment of the revitalised Batman franchise, dead stars, posthumous Oscars, arrests at premiers, will it lead to a rise in knife crime? Etc. but the only relevant question is it any good? Well Hamlet this is not so all those five star reviews and people intent on gushing all over it can calm down. Yes its dark, yes Batman is plagued by his demons, yes Heath is great, it's not comparable to Michael Mann's Heat, when all is said and done this is an OK superhero movie but considering it cost $185 million its hard to see where all that money has been spent. From a bank heist beginning that meanders to a pointless appearance of the Scarecrow to Bale flying on to the screen it seems to push all the right buttons and at the point that the Joker does his magic trick you could still be forgiven for thinking this is a five star visual feast. But unfortunately the set up doesn't really lead anywhere, there are no set pieces and at times it is even incoherent in its plot which could be from trying to cram too much information in an already overlong film. The twists, yes there are a few, are boringly obvious and I'm really not sure what happens to Bruce Wayne's voice when he dons the Batsuit but it changes to sound like a sort of vaudevillian heavy breather. That said Heath did make me laugh, he is not the most iconic screen bad guy since Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, but he is good and the supporting cast all put in fine performances. The musical style has been borrowed from a Michael Mann film and the direction is brilliant in parts but as a whole it doesn't seem to gel together. Ironically the Jokers catch phrase is 'why so serious?' And if all involved had maybe listened to him and not be so serious, pretentious even then it may have been a much better film all round. Worth watching but not, as according to the IMDb, the greatest film of all time.~5
The Dark Knight~25 July 2008~Sick Product of a Sick System~"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is a tacky, trashy, mindless, ultra violent piece of garbage. It will bore anyone with a mature mind. ""The Dark Knight"" consists of one sadistic, pointlessly violent scene after another. There is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life. ""The Dark Knight"" is a drug. It pushes violence and sadism. That's it. That's what you get for your ten bucks.""The Dark Knight"" is a sick product of a sick system. What's the difference between a blockbuster death-fest like this, and an act of actual terrorism? How many deaths do films like this contribute to? How much suffering? Pointless, ugly, violent, sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination, life experience, wisdom or balance.Teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three-dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this: cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance. Hey, Thanks, Hollywood, for flushing your refuse into young male minds. Ka-ching. How much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing? Let's up the ante.The Plot? Heath Ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks, costumes and make-up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal / master actor. There is no real performance there because there is no real life there. In one scene, Ledger, a slight young man, murders a very large, muscular, professional criminal, and a black man  white supremacists will like that part  with a pencil. No. In real life that would not happen. Nor, in real life, would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film.The movie is utterly implausible. This won't matter to its fans, who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do. In their solipsistic, computer-generated echo chamber, ""The Dark Knight"" is the greatest film ever made. These fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves, and can't see any flaws in their judgment. Though saturated in violence, these fans can't even see why a skinny guy like Ledger murdering a muscular, hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly, nasty, scene that exists only to up the sadism ante, not to have any relationship with reality. Though saturated in violence, these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world, with the real violence occurring in places like Iraq, or federal prisons.Christian Bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman. He's hardly on screen here. There is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes, and as for the special effects, how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently? Nothing new. Nothing interesting. The intelligent viewer will move along, or simply select a better film."~1
The Dark Knight~7 February 2009~I hated this trash~"Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a ""good"" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash."~5
The Dark Knight~18 July 2008~"Let's be honest - They should just call this movie ""The Joker"""~"Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again.Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly:If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff ""Batman"" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of ""Two-Face."" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie.I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film."~8
The Dark Knight~15 October 2018~It's like a really bad joke - Please Read~"Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute. ""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc"~2
The Dark Knight~30 August 2008~The 'Dull' Knight~It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere.The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change.Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version.Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.~1
The Dark Knight~2 April 2012~Tedious~Other than Heath Ledger's magnificent, brooding and evil Joker, I am stunned by the rating here on IMDb. I found The Dark Knight noisy, overlong and annoying. Joker demands that Batman reveal his real identity or someone will die every day at random. A newly appointed district attorney claims to be Batman. He is abducted and placed in a building with explosives. Dent's face is badly burned in an explosion, but he survives.More bombs go off followed by chases on motorcycle and confrontation with the Joker, mobsters and various other villains.I completely lost interest in this endless, two and a half plus hour fiasco. Christopher Nolan needs serious counseling and to learn that some things need to be left out. Rest in peace, Mr. Ledger, it wasn't your fault.? ~6
The Dark Knight~23 December 2008~Great Film~"Dark Knight, The (2008)**** (out of 4)I'll be honest and admit that I'm not much of a fan of the so called ""comic book"" movies out there. I'll also be honest and admit that I didn't care for the previous series of Batman movies from Burton and Schumacher. Batman Begins on the other hand was a different story as it found it to be incredibly good but a rare occasion as occurred as this sequel is even better. I've always felt that comic book movies didn't contain enough elements of a dark nature nor did they contain very much adult-themed stuff but that's certainly not the case here as this movie contains enough character development and moral questions for three movies. The epic nature of this movie makes it a one of a kind even though I think the 151-minute running time is the only fault in the film. It's rather amazing at how dark this movie is yet movie crowds ate it up but perhaps they ate so much of it up simply because of how dark it is. This film works on so many levels but I think the biggest are its screenplay and actors. The darkness of the story is perfectly brought to the screen by Nolan with his masterful direction, which paints the perfect picture of corruption, greed and moral responsibility. All of the characters from The Joker to Harvey Dent to even Batman must face various moral issues and this type of stuff not only makes for great drama but it brings a lot of depth to this ""comic book"" movie. The performances are all quite remarkable and that includes the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Before seeing the film I kept asking myself if his performance could top that of Jack Nicholson but I think that question shouldn't even be asked as both performances are so completely different that you can't compare them. Ledger certainly steals the show and leaves the viewer with goose bumps each time he's on the screen. It really seems as if he just floats through each scene as if he were a ghost roaming around. The walk that Ledger brings to the character is so refreshing and original that I couldn't take my eyes off of him. That wonderful talk and the brilliant line giving just adds to the fun and was it ever great to see such a dark villain. Christian Bale is also once again very good in the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Again, the screenplay benefits Bale greatly by having him just as dark as the villains. Aaron Eckhart is getting overshadowed by Ledger but he too really deserves a lot of credit as he probably gives the best performance of anyone dealing with the moral issues. His stint as Dent is perfect for a hero and his turn as Two-Face is perfect for a villain. Maggie Gyllenhaal also does a good job in the love interests role as does Michael Caine, Eric Roberts and Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman also shines in his role of Gordon. What makes the special effects so great is that the movie isn't in their hand as far as entertainment goes. Yes, the effects and chase sequences look great but they work even better because the screenplay gives us characters to care about. I won't go as far as to call this one of the greatest films ever made but I do think it has to change the way comic book movies are made."~0
The Dark Knight~13 July 2021~#Movie Review~Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still..? ~10
The Dark Knight~18 July 2008~Who ever said becoming was better than become?~"It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible.BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful.Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that ""I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma."" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, ""this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died."" Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain.The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie.This is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten."~7
The Dark Knight~2 January 2009~The Dark Truth~What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth.~5
The Dark Knight~16 February 2013~Overrated~I don't know if I'm part of a minority who found The Dark Knight be a big disappointment but I don't really care. I mean I've always been a big Batman fan and I love Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises but The Dark Knight just didn't work for me even though it's often considered one of the greatest superhero movies ever. But I think people are giving it FAR too much credit. I mean IMDb users put it higher than such classics as The Lord of the Rings, Psycho, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Rear Window and many more on the Top 250 list. That's just going too far!Okay, I'll admit that there are some really good things about the film such as Heath Ledger's performance. Of course, everyone thinks he was the best Joker. I mean before I saw The Dark Knight, I had never even heard of him, I didn't even know he had died even though he was a rising star with such films as Brokeback Mountain and I'm Not There. But I have to say he totally deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor even though some people make controversy about it. And the action scenes are really good too.But what I really don't like about this movie is that the plot isn't very subtle or coherent. I found some parts confusing and I'm surprised how overlooked the plot holes are. Also I was disappointed with Two- Face. I mean he wasn't in it for very long and it felt like he didn't really add anything to the story. He was just angry that his girlfriend Rachel died, he wasn't really suffering a mental illness, he just wanted to get revenge. Also I never liked Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel because she was weak and ugly and I think she didn't really fit the role. I preferred Katie Holmes. Also I think the film focused more on the Joker than Batman even though Ledger's Joker was excellent. But Batman is the main character.Maybe one of the reasons why this film gets so much hype and praise is because it was one of Heath Ledger's last films and they're being generous to it or he's the main reason why everyone loves it. But I personally think this film is very over-hyped and overrated. But even though I'm a huge Batman fan, I'll just stick to watching Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns and Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises.~6
The Dark Knight~15 December 2008~Not nearly as good as Batman Returns~It's hard to believe that this film rates in the Top 10 of all IMDb-rated movies. Sure, it deserves more than 5 stars on Heath Ledger's performance alone. But let's face it: This movie doesn't hold a candle to Nolan's first Batman effort.There is very little plot. There is a whole heckuva lot of brooding. There is dark aplenty, but to what purpose? I got so tired of it, I was ready to just have Heath get rid of Batman for once and all.The Nolan/Christian Bale combo is dynamite, but this screenplay and plot is anything but.Still, there is Heath Ledger, and he is really superb. What a loss for us all. And, as always, the movie LOOKS great, filled with the typical Nolan touches. I've recovered and I'm ready for a third Nolan/Bale effort, just with a bit more thought to story and at least some measure of action.~5
The Dark Knight~13 April 2012~If not 'the dark knight'....then nothing~I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for....? ~9
The Dark Knight~19 April 2011~Dark Knight is Overrated~I gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film - it doesn't deserve the 10th place on top 250 list. There is no way that this film deserves ten points!Heath Ledger was great in his role as a Joker - no doubt about that. His early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie. Without Joker this film would have much less ten point votes.Story really was bloated with too many characters - most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline. Scarecrow and batman-boys (or what they were called) were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie. Story was all over the place and it didn't have the consistency or the red line that it could follow. Many scenes were just boring and ridiculous. This film really didn't give nothing good to the whole Batman saga.~1
The Dark Knight~14 August 2008~Over long, rambling, episodic, pompous. Nice effects though.~"Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way."~6
The Dark Knight~6 April 2009~fanboy cacca~"A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like ""masterpiece"" and ""crime-epic"". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want ""more realism"" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things."~1
The Dark Knight~13 September 2008~Note to Dark Knight staff:~"From the desk of Warner Brothers Marketing department:Please note that the release of the new Batman movie we just completed already has plenty of fanfare behind it. Sadly, one of the actors can no longer partake in the new photo shoots and ads. Our job will be to catapult it above any other movie, and we have a plan for this, but first, let's discuss some things about the movie. I know not all of you have seen the movie in it's completion because, frankly, it's a mess. The editing department couldn't make heads or tails out of half the scenes before we had to involve the director to see what in the world was going on in his mind. So here it is in a nutshell:We all think it turned out to be an good action movie. It's story was fairly well constructed, with more going then just a simple superhero against the bad guy movie. Being better than 'Begins', you didn't have to go through the origins of Bruce Wayne, & instead focus on the meat of the story. And we like Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey. It all sounds great, but that's where the great ends.See, the movie just had to cluster another bad guy, Two-Face, into the movie an hour and 45 into it. It made for a tremendously long movie. In a movie like, say X-men, it's good to be long, since each character can share some interesting interaction for screen time. A movie like Batman should never clock more then 2 hours, yet at 152 minutes, Dark Knight over-stretches it's welcome. Scenes that just went on and on with conversations. Even during the movie, we knew editing could have been better, and some speeches between the characters were either redundant or overdone.The story even dwindles with the Joker, teasing us with past issues that could have been real but perhaps aren't. When Alfred said ""some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."", he described Joker pretty well, and it was one of the best quotes in the movie. But the purpose of a good movie that has good vs. evil is that the bad guy has more depth then the good guy, in some cases, we fall in love with the bad guy and can almost seem to go along with him, if not his actions, then the ends to his means. Or perhaps the fallacies that we see in all of us, as scary as it seems to see that deep into ourselves how the 'evil' in some movies reflect that mean spirit in some of us represented with a social comment, like media or government. You can even compare a movie like V for Vendetta and you can begin to see what we mean.Batman may be the ultimate representation of a good guy with an 'attitude' that goes after criminals that seemingly have no agenda but to be out of their minds. He was grown and started as a creature during the depression, as a shining light against the evil corporations and government. We see it in the comic books. Dark Knight, however, will be a raging success, not because it makes a social commentary or deep character study, but because the general public eats up popular figures with action scenes that doesn't have to make us think, only try to fill in our desires of revenge with interesting technological gadgets.Here are some better movies: Better action: Matrix, Wanted, cheesy 80's sci fi movies, like Terminator Better story lines: Sin City, V for Vendetta, Seven Samurai Better Superheros with Attitudes: Wolverine, Hellboy, Conan, Lobo And of course, Better bad guys: Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Anton Chigurh (from No Country For Old Men), hell we even like Kaiser Soze- Any of the above bad guys can have an entire book based on them. I can write a description of the Joker in one small paragraph.Another problem may be that Warner Brothers has put all their eggs into Batman, Superman notwithstanding. Marvel comics now owns the rights to superheroes on the screen, together with Iron Man, Hulk, & the upcoming Thor and Captain America. They have a vision for the big picture for the future of ""The Avengers"" in 2011 (?) That's a crap-load of heroes but if they play the cards easy, & it shouldn't be too hard, they will have a winning formula for future projects involving even more comic book heroes. But whereas Marvel was busy creating a production company to make business with many of the characters in the Marvel Universe, we.. well..Anyway, what we need you all to do... every single one of you, from the cameramen to the gaffer, is to sign up on places like IMDb and other movie sites, and give Batman a 10. Write up a review that shows none of the above, make sure you plug for emotional effect with the passing of our fine fellow actor, & make it seem like he deserves an Oscar.-WBMDPS: After the write ups and ratings boosts are done, come back to the premiere party next week for biscuits and coke!"~5
The Dark Knight~12 May 2009~"""The Dark Joker"" or ""21st Century Ennui"""~"The last time I had to ask so many questions during a film was during incomprehensible existential timewaster ""Tron"" (so now you also know roughly how old I am!). Significant exceptions aside, this is the ""Tron"" of the modern-day blockbuster world. I emerged saying ""yeah, well"".I loved ""Batman Begins""; Christian Bale is my favourite Batman; and with this many great actors, it should have been a steal. Michael Caine in particular brings, with his briefest appearance on screen, a wonderful sense of comfort and pathos. But despite all this – despite a general tone suitable to a post-traumatic, mid-recession era – I was left entirely agreeing with a reviewer who described feeling unaccountably ""disconnected"" from the culture that spawned this film. The breathless adulation that some have heaped on the film has astonished me.I love dark things: I love film noir; and films of all sorts whose characters who struggle with their souls' messy urgings. But ""The Dark Knight"" is all dark looks and no urgings. Lots of reviewers have praised the 'dark Gotham' design: huh? It's modern-day New York in low light and with extra night thrown in! How is that brilliant? And the crime wave? You want a truly dark tone, watch ""Serpico"" or ""Blue Collar"". To make a really good action film about corruption, everyone – literally everyone – needs to be, or to seem, corrupt. How much more interesting would this film have been if Rachel, Alfred and Lucius Fox were under suspicion, or better still, actually corrupt and working against Batman? Or if Batman were found in his Penthouse by Rachel, curled up naked and whispering mad nothings like a Gotham Howard Hughes? Bale was half asleep, or may as well have been – what a waste of that intense face, his physicality! Ledger was very, very impressive, and this was his film – he would eventually have made the lists of the really great actors if he could have kept from doing rubbish films like ""Casanova"". The charismatic Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pleasant change but even she can't perform the magic trick of making a meaningful character from an underwritten part. I've seen the Batman back catalogue, but throughout this I kept asking: ""soshe knows that Bruce is Batman?"" ""soshe loves him but she's marrying someone else?"" ""so.she's known him all his life? Who IS she?"" I had no idea that this was the same girl Batman had brushed with in ""Begins"", so for me, there was no history, no connection, no tension. Everything got absorbed in the central, overstretched idea of Batman's inner darkness versus the Joker's chaos theory.Like the vision of purgatory that is Batman's temporary lair while Wayne Manor is being rebuilt, mostly I think this film is about nothing more or less than the state of being bored. Batman is bored of his dual lifestyles. The Joker is bored of playing all by himself, the only intelligent psychopath in Gotham. Harvey is bored of winning his not very interesting games of chance. Glass-and-steel Gotham is 1980s dull; crime, which is money, is boring – so boring that the Joker sets his money on fire. That party Bruce throws for Harvey – come on! – the most boring party on earth; Rachel's ""love"" triangle is the most boring love triangle ever. Maybe a different style altogether would have helped bring this spin on the story alive, such as comic animation in tune with the TV series, or hyper-stylised like ""Sin City"", which seems apt.It's absurd to imagine that this film – mere dark-toned spun sugar confection that it is – merits a place in any generation's top 100 list. Here's a revolutionary idea: how about NO more Batman, in this guise at least? Leave the superheroics in the capable hands of Iron Man and Hellboy and move on."~5
The Dark Knight~23 November 2011~Not a good Batman film. Over-rated in the Extreme.~"damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. I've only seen this twice and don't plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).I've seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the ""campy"" Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesn't make Christopher Nolan's films the comic book equivalent of the ""godfather"" or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burton's 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is ""the dark knight"" worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think ""if the story is engaging enough, we don't have to make the movie visually appealing"". thats like saying ""if the story is good enough, we don't have to make batman look awesome in the comics"".lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar I'm sure with jack Nicholson's classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters aren't really who they should be. first off, joker doesn't fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didn't already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that we've seen time and again. Heath didn't really even play the﻿ Joker, he played ""generic serial killer bad guy #13314"". for those who would defend ledger by saying he was ""really scary and terrifying"", sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.﻿ Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some cliché ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.I'm not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his ""performance"" in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, ""hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky"". his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still don't understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolan's hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go ""OOH Awesome"" for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batman's are ""smart"" but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out ""deep"" monologues? its so....meh. i'd rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like ""bob, gun"". today you have ""why so serious?"". yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burton's films were dark too but not so much to the point where they weren't fun or exciting. again, disappointed."~1
The Dark Knight~17 February 2020~I tried watching it 12 years later still can't.....~One of Nolan's worst films..... Bales voice is hilarious. Ultra cheese-fest it's like a bad network television show lmao.? ~1
The Dark Knight~6 July 2008~the best batman movie till date! take a bow director~It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.? ~10
The Dark Knight~6 September 2008~Over-hyped and Convoluted~seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio, Jesus! It wasn't that good dude! Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia! The movie was trying to be too many things. It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama! Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre. It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10as a followup on this day Aug 30th, 2011, I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie! If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a high-school football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good, he agreed. Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels! I rescind my previous review!~9
The Dark Knight~23 November 2017~Not what Batman is supposed to be~In Christopher Nolan's darker reboot of the Batman franchise, Christian Bale plays the masked hero. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers.My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains—Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow—were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo.There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary and upsetting images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.~2
The Dark Knight~19 July 2008~I cannot find words to describe the brilliance of this film~In short, The Dark Knight is everything any Batfan could have dreamed of. It is the best of 2008, the best comic book film of all time, and one of the greatest action films ever made. It is carried by the titanic performances of Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart, and stands for more than it seems on the surface, much like its hero.To be honest, I really don't know where to begin. The film has NO flaw as far as I can see (although Bale's take on Batman's voice was noticeably more annoying here, maybe because he spent more time in the suit than he did last time). Christopher Nolan's craft and aptitude for understanding this story...the Batman archetype...is unparalleled. This is not just a comic book film. It's a story of what will happen when you leave the race of men no choice. It's a story of what will happen when desperation takes over the souls and minds of all. And lastly, it's a story of how a man's bond and love for his city affects him. This film is going to undoubtedly going to end up as my favorite film of 2008, and is the only film this year so far to receive a 10 out of 10 rating from me.I know you're all itching to see what I think of the acting, so without further ado, let's go there. Though this is a Batman film, the film is not about Batman...it's about Harvey Dent. It's about his struggle, his pain, his life...and there is no greater actor to play the part than Mr. Aaron Eckhart. An admirable performance saves the film from being too lopsided in the favor of a certain clownish psychopath. Eckhart's show is deep, riveting, and when he inevitably becomes Two Face, emotionally disturbing and destructive. Definitely the most surprising show of the film. Christian Bale's take on Batman...well, I never thought I'd say this, but he didn't actually improve on anything here. It's not in Bale's top 5 as far as performances go, and I got a bit of a wooden vibe from him occasionally. Overall, however he is good enough to the point where he isn't completely overshadowed. The next best show would be from Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. He really is the only truly good character in the movie, and Oldman's immediate warmth and likability make his show a great one. I enjoyed brief cameos from Cillian Murphy, Bill Fichtner, and Michael Jai White, as well as the performances of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman (although, like Bale, it's more of the same).I think I'm forgetting someone...OH YEAH! Maggie Gyllenhaal totally erased the memory of Katie Holmes from my mind. Gyllenhaal was excellent as both the fierce and dedicated ADA Rachel Dawes, and the fragile love interest of Bruce and Harvey. Great all around.I still can't help but feel as if I've forgotten something...The action in this film...well, needless to say, it's jaw dropping. Though there was less emphasis on the hand to hand fighting and more on the big bang booms, it was more than understandable because the villains are not as skilled of fighters as our dear Batman is. The film refuses to relent, and borders on horror-like territory numerous times in the film. Despite the length, I never found myself bored or wanting it to end. On the contrary, I was sort of hoping that Heath Ledger would never leave the screen.Oh...THAT'S what I forgot...Ladies and gentlemen, here's the night's entertainment. Without the titanic, terrifying, riveting, and masterful performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, this film sinks. The film rides on the shoulders of Batman's arch-nemesis, and Ledger takes it and runs away with it. I have trouble finding words to describe how Ledger's Joker made me feel both as I was watching and after. To put it simple, and I'm not lying, Ledger had me shaking for hours after the credits rolled. His voice, his posture, his delivery, his demeanor...all of it makes for the best villainous performance since Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, and arguably the best villainous performance of all time. Though the viewer hates The Joker with every fiber of themselves, you can't help but be in awe of the mesmerizing show put on by Mr. Ledger. You won't be able to take your eyes off of him.A battle between good and evil doesn't describe the tension between Joker and Batman...it's more like a battle of completely opposite ideals. The Joker, who reigns and revels in anarchy, and Batman, who aims for order and planned course of action. I've never seen a better realization of the relationship between these two comic book titans. However, let us not forget that this movie is more about Harvey Dent than the others, and that most of Joker's actions revolve around Dent's actions, not Batman's. In fact, Joker reminds us that Batman is actually an obstacle to get to Dent.Really, I don't know where to end this review, so I think this is a good place. The Dark Knight is everything any cinemagoer could hope for, and more than anything a Batfan could ever dream of. Though the ending will certainly be controversial amongst Batfans, I don't think it could have ended any other way. Packed with extreme action, a bajillion plot twists, and the most terrifying performance in years make for the best film of 2008, and possibly one of the best of all time. The Dark Knight is perfect film-making, and I plan on seeing it at least 3 more times before it leaves theaters.Oh, and it goes without saying that Ledger deserves an Oscar win for this film.~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~22 November 2006~All Good Things come to an End!~"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 February 2022~Still the greatest movie ever made~Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!? ~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~15 February 2020~Great~Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic.? ~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~9 March 2011~Pretty much outstanding~I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~16 March 2005~They saved the best for last~Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~16 March 2006~I lived to see them all!~"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~30 November 2007~Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts~"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 December 2003~A monumental film~Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 December 2003~My objective and unhyped view? Stunning. Simply stunning.~Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film. For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent. Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well. I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes. There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end. To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!) This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent. Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension). Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role. I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things. Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny. Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish. He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way. It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment. Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game. Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was! This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film. Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film. It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~1 September 2005~Brilliant. Simply brilliant~Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~14 March 2023~The Journey Ends with a Unique Movie.~"This movie made me love Cinema. Some movies mades you love that genre, this made me love Cinema. It's not perfect since there are no perfect movies actually. But this one is the Achievement of being the closest to the perfect for me.This movie is the best movie of the all time for me, clearly. I just gained my Cinema love with this movie. And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie. But this movie is still the best for me, not even a single movie reached to it's level. This is why I think the movie is the best movie of the future also. I don't think my thoughts will ever change.This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.""You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.""""Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.""Both dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit. Brilliant and the most effective storyline. And they adapted it amazingly well!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 December 2020~BEST TRILOGY EVER~In my opinion,this is one of the best movie ever, maybe the best.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~16 December 2003~"Not only the best of the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, but sets a new standard of epic filmmaking."~Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 April 2014~LOTR ROTK Review~After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 December 2009~The journey and the destination are both well worth the investment of time~I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~15 January 2020~The conclusion of 'epic'~It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 December 2003~A Brilliant Conclusion~As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 March 2021~Quite Literally the Greatest Trilogy Ever Made~I'm not sure what could be said about LOTR that hasn't already been said, other than that I personally think it's best trilogy ever put to screen, and I really can't think of anything close. Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~5 October 2007~An epic ending~"""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 April 2022~The Epic Conclusion~"Note: this is a review of the extended edition of the film.Peter Jackson's trilogy concludes with a terrific finale that makes the near 12 hour long journey we take as viewers one of the most worthwhile cinematic experiences in history. I like to think of the entire trilogy as one long movie-filmed simultaneously but obviously having had to be released over three parts to be profitable at the box office. Much like Tolkien's novel itself, having to be split in three volumes.The quality of production and post-production all maintains its standards across the trilogy. I would like to say that although ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" remains my personal favorite of the three, ""The Return of the King"" being the one that finally brought home the clean sweep at the Oscars is very fitting and deserved.The reincorporated scenes from the extended editions of all of these movies really helps a lot in fleshing out the world of Middle Earth. I can't imagine going back now to the theatrical cuts. A few scenes here and there do slow down the pacing just a bit, but in a movie as grand and epic as this, it's all for the better to extend our time in this unforgettable fantasy world that Tolkien so vividly described and that Jackson so faithfully brought to life on the big screen."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~19 February 2020~Perhaps the greatest film ever made.~It is difficult to argue that many films should sit on top of the mountain of the greatest movies ever made, but one of those is The Return of the King. Technical, writing, and production aspects are all the best you can have in a film.The most impressive thing about ROTK is that it is the series ' third entry and that it is so good. Most trilogies that exist have the problem of the third being the weakest in the bunch. Not with this trilogy, though, this film is incredible on all levels.This film's drama and overall epicness is something I have simply not seen since its release. Not many films can so effortlessly blend fantasy and serious dramatic plot elements that sell the film's overall message.Not to forget the amazing display of acting that the whole cast put together. This is one aspect of the movie that does not appear to be getting enough credit. EVERYONE sells every scene and contributes to the film's immersion.The Return of the King holds the record, in a tie, for the most academy awards ever won and I cannot think of another film more deserving of this honor. The world-building displayed by Peter Jackson, coupled with the cast and crew, has not been matched outside of this series.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~13 March 2021~The only movie I don't want to finish~If we consider The Fellowship of the Ring is a history, we could consider The Two Towers as a legend,and we could consider The Retern of the King as a myth.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~1 November 2019~The epic conclusion to the story~Before I talk about this movie, I want to say that I got my aged grandmother hooked on the series. I would visit her every Saturday, and I brought the first two movies over on DVD and we watched them. She was hooked. Peter Jackson did such a good job bringing the books to life. Surely there was a lot left out, he would have needed six movies to fit in everything from these novels. I am happy to say that I brought my grandmother to the theater to see this when it came out, and for the entire run, she did not move an inch. To me that says all there can be said about this movie. To see a woman well in her 80, so transfixed was such a treat. This movie is sad and happy all at the same time and is wonderfully done.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~2 March 2021~Almost Perfect~I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. This movie--this trilogy really--is in no need of my praise, so I'll say that there were just a couple of moments of exasperation for me (which I guess will happen over a three plus hour movie). Among the points of exasperation was a point when I wanted to slap Frodo. I'm sure that part needs no mention.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 February 2020~The epic conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time~The Return of the King is an impressive film because it wraps up the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a way that is satisfying for both fans of the books and those who have only seen the movies. This finale is a rollercoaster of emotions, with impressive sets, elaborate costumes, and eye-popping visual effects. The Lord of the Rings was already a great novel, but it has now become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~24 March 2020~The end of an era~A Blu-ray extended version for almost four and a half hours. The scene of the war is still magnificent. It is Frodo's luck to have a good friend like Sam. Gandalf is still otherworldly and holy. The last part of the play makes my eyes wept. This is the end of the epic blockbuster and an era. But classics will become eternal.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~30 August 2021~What a finale!~Simply magnificent! The production is just breath-taking!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 January 2015~one movie to rule them all~"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~23 December 2015~15 years on... Still the greatest~I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 August 2019~A Timeless Classic~This movie, and trilogy in general, is a cinematic (and literary) masterpiece, and simply refuses to get old. I love this movie so much it's become a tradition to watch the Lord of the Rings series at least once a year! It's just as good as Christmas? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 January 2012~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) - My Precious, This is a Masterful Final Chapter!~"Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, ""The Lord of the Rings"" series finally comes to a close, with ""The Return of the King"". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. ""LOTR: The Return of the King"", in my review, ""an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece""."~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~26 April 2012~"""Songs for great halls"""~"Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says ""So passes Denethor"" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~21 October 2005~3rd time's the charm (don't get me wrong; the first two were equally good).~"It all comes down to this. The humans and hobbits now have their final battles to fight with the forces of evil. I can't actually say anything about ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" that does it justice, except to say that it is a great movie in the true sense of the word. Everything that we've awaited in life is summed up in this piece of cinematic history. Every one of the cast members does a masterful job. Therefore, it makes sense that this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture, and won EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. ""LOTR: TROTK"" is THE movie that you have to see to believe. It is everything that we like about movies.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 May 2004~The Conclusion of an Adventure in the Same Level of the Other Two Parts of a Splendid Story~The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story. The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is again outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. The eleven Oscars, the IMDB User rating of 9,0 with 62,820 votes and the 2,219 reviews are sufficient. I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film. Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix, where the first film was excellent, but the sequences were very disappointing. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): `O Senhor dos Anéis: O Retorno do Rei' (`Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The')? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~20 December 2003~A legitimately great movie~An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~24 October 2020~I cry buckets every time~I'm writing this review as I watch Fellowship again right now. I was 12 when Fellowship first released in the cinema, and LOTR defined my life ever since for many years, and the trilogy has remained my favourite movies, with no others that come close. They made me cry in the cinema, and in every viewing since. I can put on even a brief portion of the films, and the feelings come rushing back. Everything about these three movies is perfect, in my opinion, especially the amazing music that is so perfectly crafted that I can't think of a better movie soundtrack. The only OST that matches it is the Halo game soundtrack. Both the Halo and LOTR franchise began in the same year (2001), and were the two major pillars of my life since childhood.It's crazy to think that this trilogy began almost 20 years ago. I wonder if anything will ever touch LOTR. I suspect it will remain the all-time pinnacle of cinema, at least for the sheer love of them it has inspired in its vast fanbase.I think that the extended editions are indispensable and feel much more complete than the original cinematic releases. They are definitely worth watching in one sitting, back-to-back, which will take from wake til sleep, with breaks in between for second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, supper.Although I think Return of the King is the greatest possible ending to the greatest trilogy ever made, I still feel Fellowship of the Ring, where it all began, is the most rewatchable and comfy of the three. It has an air of enticing, dark and foreboding mystery that always captivates me. And that ending... what a cliff-hanger. I still remember the excitement it first created in me for the story's continuation, and the year-long wait for The Two Towers to release in the cinema. I would pay good money to see them all in a large and full theatre again.And the video games... I played most of them I think. I still play Battle for Middle Earth, i.e. the Edain mod.I can't imagine what my life would have been like if the LOTR films had never been created as they were, as they have been that important to me for well over half of my time alive at this point. They played a part in inspiring me to travel, to pursue filmmaking, and most importantly to get me interested in Tolkien's works.I am so thankful to everyone who were a part of creating them, as they are easily the greatest treasure of cinema.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~21 June 2010~The great film saga of our time.~The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'.I saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional.'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real.'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well.Any gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame.As you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it.Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~31 January 2020~Phenomenal...~"The 2003 conclusion to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a tour de force. This is by all accounts the best movie in the entire trilogy.Why? Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a solid eight out of ten stars."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 August 2022~There is nothing that isn't perfect about this movie except you never want it to end.~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) Extended Edition is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows our heroes marching to their doom in hopes of saving Middle Earth. Sam and Frodo continue slithering through the mountains in hopes of destroying the ring with Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragon and friends prepare to stand off against Sauron's army in hopes of distracting them long enough for Frodo to slip by then and destroy the ring. Likelihood for success is low but hope is high...This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Viggo Mortensen (Hidalgo), Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Liv Tyler (Armageddon).There is nothing that isn't perfect about this movie except you never want it to end. The settings are so beautiful and well filmed. The cast is perfectly selected and demonstrate both their desperation and their will to push forward. The inner struggles within every character is perfectly depicted. The attire, props and use of CGI to create both magic and monsters was awesome. The battle scenes are epic and the ending is absolutely amazing and closes the trilogy perfectly.Overall this is the greatest fantasy series ever created that is an absolute must see. I would score this a strong 10/10 and consider it an absolute must see.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 March 2016~Looses Nothing~"The 3rd and final film of the LotR series. This one looses nothing it only continues the story. Picks up right where ""Two Towers"" leaves off. Grittier story, more foe & dirtier grittier battles - the worst is yet to come... The Witch King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgul.This film has an air of horror to it... more frightening than the first two films. In the end, you whistle is wet for more.A wicked film well worth watching. High fantasy fans as well as those who love a lot of action and adventure will enjoy watching this one for the first time or again and again.10/? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~20 December 2003~Five out of five decapitated orcs~This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that).~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~23 October 2011~A film ahead of its time, Lord of The Rings The Return Of the King is the best thing I have ever seen...~"Even after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong!This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it.You really get that feeling of ""The Return"". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important.For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies)10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 July 2008~The Return of the King is an epic finish to the LOTR.~The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jackson's portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice, courage, and friendship. Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes, especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~24 January 2021~This is how perfection looks like.~I started re-watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy few days ago. Today i saw Return of the King, and i gotta say it's the best of the trilogy. The whole trilogy is perfect, not a single flaw. I can never get bored of these movies. Return of the king is an absolute masterpiece. Incredible job by everyone in the cast and crew.Fellowship of the Ring is the perfect start. The Two Towers is the perfect continuation. The Return of the King is the perfect ending to the trilogy. What a thrilling journey!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 December 2003~The end of the Journey~"The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The ""That still only counts as one"" line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 December 2003~Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film~In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end. The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole. Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up. In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it. It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place. Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~5 February 2022~THE BEST TRILOGY IN HISTORY~As I'm writing this I can't quite believe that this was 20 years ago. I've seen these three films a gazillion times and regularity watch them at least once a year. The Two Towers is my favourite and when Retun came out I didn't like the ending... mostly because I think I was just sad to realise it was all over but also because the last half hour feels like it has about three endings and keels going. But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT. If you don't love these movies then you seriously have no soul. And if you've read the books you'll know that it was a near impossibly task to make them at all. Jackson has pulled of the seemingly impossible.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~30 January 2020~A perfect end to my personal favorite trilogy~What isn't great about this. This characters are developed wonderfully, the acting is brilliant, the epic effects blow me away, the score is perfect. This is my personal favorite of the three but mind you, it is an extremely hard choice? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 November 2019~Still the best movie ever made. The one movie to rule them all.~I don't have to add anything to that. The battles, drama, acting, score, sets, characters and effects are at the apex of moviemaking. The 4 hour extended cut is a must see with many memorable added moments. Spectacular and jaw dropping. Jackson achieved something we may never again see in our lifetimes.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 November 2020~A PIECE OF MY SOUL LIVES IN THIS FILM~Still the Greatest Piece of Storytelling Put to Film, A Timeless Ageless Classic. I Will Never Get Tired of Watching This Powerhouse Epic, A True Masterpiece, And Far As I Am Concerned, Still the Greatest Movie Hollywood Has Ever Produced In My Time.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~10 January 2007~What can you say?~I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 January 2004~Very good end to a very good set of movies.~This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one. This one has epic battles and great visuals as well. It is also very well acted. Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~21 January 2019~This movie has marked my childhood!~It is the best movie I can remember I've watched while I was a kid!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 December 2016~"Third-Hobbit, Third-Wizard, Third-Cinematic-Genius... makes one of the Greatest Cinematic ""Thirds""..."~"I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.""Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!""This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature.And through this ""Return of the King"", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed ""to have a story before the story"", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity.Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of ""The Return of the King"" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake.And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a ""The End"" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections.Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Titanic"" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~5 October 2013~The Greatest Film Trilogy of All Time~Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~8 March 2017~The End Of The Epic Journey~"In terms of the individual installments of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic trilogy, Return of the King may actually be my least favorite (if only by a hair). The character-building isn't needed, like in Fellowship, and the battles are no better than those in Two Towers. The film's length (even the 3.5 hour theatrical cut) borders on prohibitive. Yet, it remains a slam-dunk 10/10 effort. The reason? The emotional payoffs to all the threads set up in those previous two installments.For a very basic overview, Return of the King sees the two primary plots of the trilogy reach their apex:-Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), & Gollum/Smeagle (Andy Serkis) finally reach Mordor--but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at the journey's end.-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again are feisty dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the marksman Elf, and hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.The overall hallmark of this concluding chapter is the way in which it pays off all the threads set up in the previous two. This one doesn't have to break new ground, and largely doesn't. It just needs to put an amen to perhaps the most incredible book-to-film adaptation of all-time, which it accomplishes with aplomb. What Jackson really understands is how much of a journey the audience has taken alongside the famous fantasy characters (especially true if experienced during the three-year theatrical run). The end of their journey is also the end of ""ours"", in other words.Specifically notable here is the last half hour or so of runtime, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some of the most emotionally rousing scenes of the whole trilogy. I have yet to behold these moments without a tear being shed.Overall, then, Return of the King is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful vision. It may not break much cinematic new ground, but it doesn't have too. It simply does its job: pay off all the previously-established action, adventure, drama, humor, and (most of all) heart."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~13 August 2014~one of the best fantasy movie ever~The hobbit movies are better. But it is still all the middle earth movies are good. This movie as a great story line. It is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. It has great acting. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie See it. It has a lot of action. It is long but so fast past that you will not notes. You could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. This is a great movie. One of the beast fantasy movie ever made. It is so cool. See all the middle earth movies they are awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it see it. Some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 February 2023~Two decades later, this is still incredible~It's just incredible how well Return of the King wraps up the overall Lord of the Rings trilogy. Things expand and branch off in wild directions in The Two Towers, likely making first-time viewers pessimistic it could all come together. But come together it most certainly does, with The Return of the King delivering spectacle, emotion, and large-scale action that few other blockbusters have come close to equaling in the 20 years since its release.Instead of gushing endlessly about things other people have already gushed about (I agree with all the positive things anyone has said), all I can really add is that the extended editions made me love The Return of the King even more. Even though the theatrical version is still about 200 minutes long, numerous great scenes didn't make the cut. Seeing them back in for a final installment that now spans 4+ hours really makes everything gel better. It made a great film into a fantastic one.I used to feel like the various endings of The Return of the King took too long. After watching all three movies as effectively one movie - and doing all the extended versions in one go to boot - the ending feels just as well-paced as the rest of the movie. All the scenes in the epilogue feel earned and truly emotional. The longer journey spent with these characters seems to make all the difference, and I feel like generally speaking, the extended versions are probably superior overall (though there's a scene or two here and there that feels superfluous for sure).Anyway, The Return of the King is fantastic. The whole trilogy is fantastic. I don't know how Peter Jackson and everyone else made such a big trilogy that all works so well. It holds up after 20+ years, and I'm starting to wonder whether it will ever even age at this point.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 October 2019~Meh it was alright~Sike this is the movie to rule them all. T Here is nothing much to say other than go watch this masterpiece of a movie. An end to the best trilogy there ever was and probably will be. All the Oscars are well deserved and you will see why when you watch this film? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 December 2018~Noooooo it's over (sad face)~"You had me at ""My friends, you bow to no one. Masterpiece and best movie that won Oscar after the Godfather. I can't believe that the Academy recognized this masterpiece and gave it an Oscar. Performances are out of this world and Serkis is again amazing as Smeagol/Gollum. The end is heartbreaking and soundtrack is perfect the whole time. Clean sweep 11/11 Oscars is the best thing that ever happend to Oscars. They should remember that days and start giving Oscars for best picture to films that actually deserved Oscar( angry Blade runner 2049 fan).? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~22 January 2022~Spectacular, More spectacular, Most spectacular~"In 2022 my plan was to review both the ""Lord of the Ring"" trilogy of Peter Jackson (2001 - 2003) and the two ""Nibelungen"" movies of Fritz Lang (1924), the reason being that both are ultimately based on the German ""Song of the Nibelungs"" and / or the Scandinavian ""Völsunga saga"". The ""Lord of the Ring"" novel by Tolkien (Jackson) and the Nibelungen opera-cycle by Wagner (Lang) functioned to a greater or lesser extent as an intermediate station with respect to these adaptations.As if they had heard about my plan, right at the start of 2022 Dutch television broadcasted al three episodes of the ""Lord of the Ring"". You can only admire the courage of Peter Jackson, because he was taking an enormous risk. How to involve all those that had not read the book in this labyrinthine story without rousing the indignation of those that had read the book (and often loved it) about leaving out too much detail?Jackson proved to be up to the task in a marvelous manner and brought the fantasy genre to the next level. Twenty years ago the computer generated images (cgi) used by Jackson were nothing less than revolutionary.In his review Roger Ebert remarked that in comparison with the novel the ""sword and sorcery"" element in the movie was emphasized too much. It was too much of ""The adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938, Michael Curtiz & William Keighley) and too little of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming). To translate this remark to the actual characters of the story. In the novel the Hobbits are realy the central characters while in the movie they are the weak spot of the group that have to be defended (in flashy action sequences of course) by the other members of the fellowship.There is a grain of truth in this comment. On the other hand, if you invest heavily in cgi and takes the fantasy genre to the next lever (as stated earlier in this review) you want some action in return, don't you?I called the story labyrinthine and indeed there are many species and races involved. The essence of the story is however rather clear.It is a story about the struggle between good and evil.The forces of the good (Hobbits, Elves, Dwars, Men) cooperate in a fellowship and are learning to appreciate each other more and more as the story unfolds.The evil as represented by the ring (lust for power) is not limited to certain characters. Anyone can in principle be infected by it. In effect there are characters that are evil in the trilogy, but had been good in earlier era's of the Tolkien story (not covered by the Jackson trilogy).""The return of the King"" is the last episode of the Ring trilogy. It is amazing that after the first two episodes Jackson is still capable of surprising his spectators. The battle at Pelennor fields in ""The return of the King"" surpasses the battle at Helm's deep in ""The two towers"", which was already taking your breath away.In the general remarks about the trilogy as a whole I defended the balance that Jackson has kept between action scenes and the Tolkien story. This does however not apply to the bombastic speeches preceding the action scenes, that irritated me more and more.Also in the general remarks I praised the computer generated images (CGI) that were state of the art at the time of release. In the scene in ""The return of the King"" in which Gandalf enters the city of Minas Tirith for the first time it striked me how well these cgi were integrated in and synchronised with the life action.While Frodo was the lead character in the first episode and Aragorn in the second, in the final episode the two lead characters were well matched. An improvement! On the other hand the character of Smeagol / Gollem is less interesting in ""The return of the King"" because his good (Smeagol) side is nearly non existent and he becomes the rather unidimensional bad Gollem.In ""The fellowship of the Ring"" Aragorn has a romance with the elf Arwen. In ""The two towers"" Eowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan, feels attracted to Aragorn. Because you expect that the battle against the evil Sauron ultimately will be won by the good forces, the big question becomes which of these two romances shall eventually come to fruition? Jackson answers this question, but in my opinion quite in a rushed way. Especially the story of Eowyn is rushed, but maybe this is less so in the extended edition of the film.Talking about Eowyn, in a MacBeth like scene she kills the Witch King of Angman, who imagined himself save on the battle field because he could not be killed by a man (just like MacBeth feels safe because no man born of woman can kill him).One of my favourite scenes towards the end is the scene in wich the Hobbits are back in the Shire, having a pint in a pub. This is the kind of life they have been fighting for, but after all they have gone through they are no longer capable of enjoying it. This realy is a scene in the spirit of Tolkien, who fought in the First World War and was of the opinion that in a war there is no winner and only losers."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 December 2006~The best 17 endings of all times!~"I think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already, but still I will try. There are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon, not this one. In front of an amazingly beautiful scenery, Peter Jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie, which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clichés and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand.Although I am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten, The ""The Lord of the Rings""-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 September 2007~The Road Goes Ever On~Well, in the LOTR book, the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears, and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version, and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily, and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliff There are many points of bitter criticism of the film, and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~19 September 2016~Peter Jackson is the best adaptation of a book to film the movie history , The Lord of The Rings is epic.~Epic is what The Lord of the Rings: The Return of King can be summarized after the excellent The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Peter Jackson excels, and can make a movie even better, the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King closes with golden key out, what I consider the best trilogy in film history, the film is even longer, the scenes are so spectacular that you do not looks not going, you twist pro film does not end, that is eternal so good, the battle scenes are spectacular, the speech of Theoden is one of the best i saw ever seen in my life, you shivers, especially with this track sound impeccable, the final scene is good, the opening scene is great, you do not know the time of the great battle begins, the visual effects are excellent, Nazgul scenes from the is very good, the costumes are amazing, the soundtrack is spectacular, 11 Oscars were more than deserved, the Lord of the Rings: the Return of King is awesome, epic, spectacular, Incredible, etc., we have an epic clash, more than satisfactory. note 10Théoden: Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin....and the world's ending!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 April 2008~The adrenaline-rushing conclusion of the Epic~Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler.In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo and Sam (who are led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that was set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry and Pippin at the now-destroyed Isengard, thanks to Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory, but Aragorn was worried about Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, which had been found and confiscated. But then something happened: the palantir revealed The Eye of Sauron and his plans to attack Minas Tirith, so Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to return home. So she rode home and begged her father to resurrect Narsil's ancient blade and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he could become the king he was born to be.So overall, all three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son; I mean, it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the friendship that is developing between Merry and Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~26 March 2022~Epic is an understatement~These films are glorious and they finished off this marvellous trilogy with a bang. Unlimited action and emotional plot twist and character arcs. Cinematography is just unparalleled to other trilogies.I have to say the more I watch this trilogy the more I put it up there with the Star Wars Classics.Timeless.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~2 July 2021~Unmatched brilliance~This movie, and its other titles, will always remain cinema gold.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~5 June 2004~Breath-taking... Awesome... ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!!~WHAT A MOVIE!!! THE SETS!!! THE MUSIC!!! THE VISUALS!!! THE ACTION!!!An amazing achievement in every sense of the word. The lack of action and slow pace of the The Two Towers is made up for here. The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing!There can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax.However the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~9 March 2022~A true masterpiece~To justify the title, I can count many merits of the movie. The background score is grand and powerful, the story is handled very well, and the CGI is balanced and beautiful. But, in the third act of the movie, there are 3 major scenes, each of which brought me to complete tears. One of them is the greatest single moment I've ever seen in movies, period. Throughout the movie, it's very evident that it was made by people who clearly adored the source and a great attention to detail can be found throughout.I've seen complaints that at some points the movie diverges from the source material too much or that it's longer and doesn't pack as much substance. I feel the first point can be validated by artistic liberties, while the second ultimately boils down to personal preferences. Speaking personally, the movie did not feel long. The screenplay justifies the runtime, and makes the movie cohesive. It's the grand finale to the greatest trilogy of all time, and completely cements its legacy for years to come.NOTE: This review is based off of the special extended editions, and not the theatrical cut.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~12 December 2021~An Epic long end to one of the greatest trilogies ever~So I have now made my way through The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and that culminates with The Return Of The King, one of the biggest films ever made and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the forces of Gondor & Rohan fight to protect Middle Earth from the forces of Mordor while Frodo, Sam & Gollum get closer to Mount Doom and their endgame.Main Character Elijah Wood is back as Frodo and I think he does a great job in selling just how tough the journey has been on Frodo compared to the other characters. The ring is just weighing him down and this film in particular he is really struggling with it and finding his mind on the brink. I mean Frodo isn't the most likeable character for parts of this film but I thought Wood did a great job in portraying the anxiety and torment that Frodo has gone through in this trilogy. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and talking about his character is pretty funny, I mean the title of the film spoils his whole character arc but he is still great here and does well in his role and just does a great job as a protagonist.Supporting Characters Sean Astin does a really good job in the first two films but this is the film where he really stands out and for me gives the best performance in the film. There is a line in The Two Towers where Frodo says he wouldn't get far without Sam and you really see it in this film, as Frodo struggles Sam gets stronger and Astin does a fantastic job in this film as the moral centre. Sir Ian McKellen is given more to do here as Gandalf The White and he is great, he gets to see more of the action and nails every moment he is on screen and just adds so much to the film. Andy Serkis is also back as Gollum and the effects are even better here, Gollum looks fantastic and the character is fleshed out here and it even better, Serkis truly deserves credit for his role here and Gollum is also a real highlight of the film. The rest of the cast also do great jobs, Miranda Otto as Eowyn gets more to do here, Bernard Hill as Theoden gets more to do, Merry and Pippin have more to do and they are all fantastic and have really good character arcs, the whole cast really do a great job in the film.Story The story is epic on all levels, more of the characters have interesting character arcs and more time to shine. The story is in three plots really, Frodo, Sam & Gollum, Gandalf & Pippin and the rest of the characters at Rohan, and all of it is really interesting. The film uses its extra runtime to flesh out more characters and makes the story be more epic and have more depth to it then the previous films. It ends the trilogy pretty much perfectly and does it really well with these characters that you will have grown to love over the 9 hours that you have watched.Script The script is great, the dialogue and ways the characters are written takes these larger then life personalities and makes you care about them which is no mean feat. This film knows when to focus on the drama and it knows when to have a laugh, it balances the plot arcs very well and makes the film interesting from start to end.Style This film is epic on scale, I mean it could be argued that in terms of scale this is the largest film ever, the battle scenes are huge in scale and raises the scale which was necessary for a final instalment of this epic franchise. The film has over 3 hours to tell its story and I think it does a good job of it and keeps the pacing high for pretty much the entire film which is a difficult thing to do.Overall Overall, I mean this is The Return Of The King so of course it is amazing, this whole trilogy is one of the greatest of all time and if people haven't watched it then they just need to get on it, especially while we are in lockdown.Rating - 10/10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 January 2004~A change of my top 5 movies~This movie is the best of everything, the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. You have to love the pros, as well as the antags. This movie as one reviewer once said of this movie, it is the best movie of this generation! The saddest part, it is the last movie. The only thing I have to say that was a downer, it needed more epic battles! So, my top 5 have now changed: 5=Scarface,4=Matrix,3=Lord of the Rings 3,2=Godfather,1=Citizen Kane.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~8 September 2016~This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date.~This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date.There are many reasons why this is the greatest. The visual effects were spectacular and they have increased the scope of any film. This film took the film-making to new heights which were previously not thought of. Peter Jackson for this very reason became one of the greatest filmmakers ever.The beginning is very simple, and it takes us to the backstory of the ring. The battle scenes are nothing short of epic. The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous.The acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me. These are characters I shall not forget ever in my lifetime.The writing by JRR Tolkein is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such visual strength to the celluloid would have been the greatest challenge for any filmmaker. Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so. He served the book readers and the film viewers hugely.Thanks to all, who have made this film and the trilogy a possibility and I am going with 5/5. Nothing less for one of the greatest films.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~31 July 2020~A perfect end to this epic trilogy~It's very rare for the third film in a series to be good but The Return of the King has surpassed that and managed to become the best film in the LOTR trilogy.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King shows Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship getting ready to fight Sauron's army whilst Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring once and for all.It has all led to this. A 3 hour and 20 minute finale to end the Lord of the Rings story and it couldn't be better. This is my favourite out of all three films as I believe Peter Jackson has crafted one of the best finales to a film ever. It's amazing how much effort and work has gone into this trilogy as this film wouldn't have the same impact if the previous two weren't planned so well. All three films have such a fantastic connection with one another. A huge amount of credit goes to the entire team working on all three films.The Return of the King is the best one as this one ups the ante. If you thought the battle at the end of The Two Towers was impressive, the battle in this film is breathtaking. The fabulous camerawork, special effects and magnitude of the fight makes this a cinematic achievement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and Howard Shore's epic score increases the intensity of the fight. I was in complete awe as nothing of this scale has been done before. I'm so happy the Academy recognised the work put into it.It's not just the fights that make this film perfect but the characters are fully developed here and given great closure. This film brings the most development to the Hobbits especially Pippin, Frodo and Sam. Pippin really grows in this film after realising what's going on and Billy Boyd did an excellent job. The friendship between Frodo and Sam developed so much here. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were so good. Once again each actor shines and give outstanding performances.With The Return of the King, Peter Jackson has successfully created a perfect and memorable trilogy that set a new standard for filmmaking. Each scene builds up to an epic finale and ending that may make you cry. J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~26 March 2022~the best movie SERIES ever made, LOTR~If you dont end up liking the LOTR movies, consider questioning your basic understanding of movies.One of the pinnacles of entertainment industry, LOTR very few things can actually beat this.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 April 2020~What we need is real happiness.~The magic world is more powerful than other magic series because of the central setting. There is no consistent black and white. The Lord of the Rings is a naked temptation. Everyone will hesitate in facing it, choose whether to overcome this temptation or be captured by it It 's all up to you. Gandalf finally said to the children: I will not let you not cry, everyone will cry. What we need is real happiness.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~31 January 2021~Watched the series for the first time on its 20th anniversary!~"The other night I had watched the first movie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and then woke up to find out it was exactly the 20th anniversary of its release!The best thing was that, unlike most other movie franchises, it got better with every sequel. Though it might get a bit hokey at times, the hearty friendship between Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee was superb and heartwarming. You just don't see grown friends crying in each other's arms anymore! The sharp distinction of good and evil, which doesn't exist in today's movies anymore, was writ large. I also liked the portrayal of the evil Lord Sauron and his hideous Orcs cutting down forests and making weapons in their macabre caverns as a metaphor for the industrial destruction of our modern world.But good wins! And this was a magnificent and fitting end to one of the most epic movie franchises ever.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~17 March 2020~My favorite Lord of the Rings movie. A great conclusion and one of my favorite movies.~The Return of the King after the two towers to me felt like a fantastic comeback, instead of lurking around certain scenes like the previous installment did at times, the return of the king dives right into the main focus of what is to come. Leading up to possibly one of the grandest wars in film history, its epic, its beautiful and poetic and certainly emotional.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~24 December 2014~An epic masterpiece made even better in its extended form~"In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before.The reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness.One of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, ""Here I am, come and get me.""In Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him.Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges.But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature.Of course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow.And then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson.I'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully – or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic.Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning.Bottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 December 2003~There are no words to describe...~How superb 'The Return of the King' is. It is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action, romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it now!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 July 2007~FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'~The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best.Aragorn takes the lead role this time, as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum (motion-captured Andy Serkis) is becoming a big problem for Sam (Sean Astin), as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself.And Pippin (Billy Boyd) pledges his allegiance to Denethor (John Noble), the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive.The ending is very long, but it isn't bad. The entire movie is riveting, magical cinema, and I ate up every minute of it. The Return of the King is a masterpiece, and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt (more than that, actually).4/4~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 July 2020~Every rewatch is awesome~Every time I watch this I have so many emotions during it. Everything from happiness to sadness. The Lord of the Rings is probably the best and most epic trilogy ever made. I will watch it many times more and enjoy every second of it.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 October 2018~Perfect Film~Peter Jackson created a masterpiece with this iconic piece cinema. Acting is superbly done especially Ian mckellan. Will always be the best film of all time.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~21 September 2005~What a Way to end, Truly amazing and one of the best films ever made~Truly a masterpiece. This film was more than worthy of its 11 Oscars. The fellowship was stunning, the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. The thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion, and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson, I feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray Tolkien's vision.Without a doubt the speech, roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long, I say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont, and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~12 February 2022~Peter Jackson did Tolkien justice~By the light of Amazon's recent massacre of the lore and franchise, I realized how great the original trilogy by Peter Jackson is. Jackson has respected the Tolkien and his writings and refused add any view from any side.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 December 2019~The Return of the King~I will keep it short, because what needs to be said has already been. This review is also spoiler-free.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is my personal favourite in the trilogy. It has the msot fight scenes out of any Lord of the Rings tale, and they are all very well written. The first big war that takes place is one of the best scenes in the saga and the ending of the movie is great. I could not fault the previous two, and it's the same for this one.Of course it is a 10/10. This movie is great, and something else I did not say previously was that I really liked everything they did with Gollum in this film. Buy it, no questions.? ~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 February 2021~The Greatest Story ever Written~"This review is about the entire trilogyI have long thought whether, and if so, how to begin a review about ""The Lord of the Rings"". Because there is probably no story that means more to me and where it is so difficult for me to be objective. I actually came across the story quite late, in 2012. I saw ""The Hobbit"" and even though, in retrospect, ""An Unexpected Journey"" doesn't come close to ""The Lord of the Rings"" in any way, the world still captivated me so much that I really wanted to see more. That very same day I bought the Trilogy-Bluray-Box and, what can I say, watched it in one go. Those almost twelve hours were a revelation. One day later I got the book and read it within a day. Today, eight years later, I like to boast that I have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of middle earth. Above my couch hangs Anduril- Flame of the West, my forearm is adorned with a Tolkien tattoo, every now and then I say a few sentences in Elvish and all my savings go into my next visit to New Zealand. I find it hard to describe what fascinates me about this story. Among other things, for me it is the pure embodiment of the magic of cinema. It is a sensitive commodity and the more the global event cinema takes hold, the more it seems to disappear. But the magic in this case is by no means based solely on the infamous budget of 300 million dollar. Among other things, it is the realistic and consistent depiction on Tolkiens world, almost like an alternative historiography. Peter Jacksons belief in a higher task and his awareness that he must not disappoint millions of Tolkien fans made this mammoth project possible in the first place. And the result is known: the fans would have rather missed Christmas than the new ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. With each film the panoramas became more splendid, the details more loving, the battles more impressive, the moments more intense; Peter Jackson brought Tolkiens unique world truly to life. The New York Times summed it up perfectly: ""Never before has anyone seen a film whose director pays such a high level of respect to the literary source. Jackson puts all his skills at the service of this reference- and he succeeds in creating the extremely rare, one might say, perfect connection between filmmaker and source material."" Although the effects alone are not the only reason for the magic of the films, ""The Lord of the Rings"" would be unthinkable without them. Only the solely digital Gollum, which steals the show in the second part, and the fighting armies in epic battles ensure the impressive physique. But it is the mixture of the special effects and the impressive props and sets that gives the series its unique aesthetic. This multifaceted world is held together by a skilful editing and excellent camera work. The clever cliffhanger structure ensures that the viewer follows the scattered companions spellbound, repeatedly interrupted by picturesque landscapes. In the end, it seems as if one has absorbed all the splendor of Middle Earth. And here is a significant difference to other sagas like Star Wars, Harry Potter or Marvel's Infinity Saga: Tolkiens World cannot be expanded at will. The great cast should of course not go unmentioned. How many actors became icons of pop culture through their roles in the trilogy, still today. And of course, Howard Shore made a decisive contribution with his unsurpassed score. Whenever I listen to ""Concerning Hobbits"", it feels like home. However, for all the points mentioned, the heart of this film series is the story. The peaceful world of the hobbits is in many ways like my own home. And the threat posed by the all-powerful Sauron is always tangible. ""The Lord of the Rings"" tells the essential story of the fight of good against evil, the smallest must defeat the biggest. It is a story of probation. Ever new experiences and losses make the heroes wiser, and also sadder. At first glance, ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems to be an extremely dark story, but it is also full of hope. Aragorn and Arwen have shown me the essence of love; Frodo and Sam, what true friendship means; Gandalf, that there is no need to fear death. With all the seemingly overpowering evil, belief in good is always preserved; the faith that ultimately helps the heroes to victory. The fateful importance of the individual becomes a topic, as does the importance of social cohesion in difficult times. The mythical structure, with its alternation between epic and intimate moments, seems like a modern ""Iliad"", for some even like a modern Bible- like for me. Under Peter Jacksons direction, three of the best films of all time were made, and for that he and the entire team will forever have my gratitude and the gratitude of many other fans.""Sam: I know, by rights we shouldn't even be here. Just hold on. It's like in the great stories Mr Frodo, the ones that really matter. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes, you don't even want to know the ending, because how can the end be happy? How can the world go back to the way it was when so much BAD had happened? But in the end, it's just a passing thing, this darkness, and even darkness must pass. And a new day will come, and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those are the stroies that really matter, that mean something, even if you were to small to understand why. But I think Mr Frodo, I know now. Folk in those stories, they had lots of chances to turn back, only they didn't. They kept going, because they were holding on to something. Frodo: What are we holding on to Sam? Sam: There's some good in this world, Mr Frodo. And it's worth fighting for."""~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~2 May 2016~Absolutely Awesome!~"It's difficult to process something like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Its very nature defies comparison.There has never been a cinematic endeavour based on a more daunting...or more beloved...literary work. There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort.Jackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more ""mainstream"" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen.And now it's over.With the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so.In tone and ""feel"", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical ""war movie"" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 April 2005~"A newbie's perspective on ""The Return of the King"""~"I haven't read the J.R.R. Tolkien books or seen the first two movies in this series, so I won't waste your time with a formal review. Here are some miscellaneous thoughts from the perspective of a Middle Earth neophyte:If you're wondering if you can understand this movie without having seen the first two, you can. I didn't realize I was watching the third installment until the end when I saw there couldn't possibly be any more story. I had a little trouble here and there, but the movie never really lost me.Roger Ebert complained that characterization in these movies is given short shrift. Maybe so, but I thought Mr. Frodo and Sam – and the love they had for each other – were very moving. For me, they were the heart of this movie. I was roused into anger when Gollum framed Sam and temporarily split the two men – are Hobbits men? – apart.Everyone says it, and everyone's right. Gollum is a great villain; it's a great performance by Andy Serkis and the CGI craftsmen who jointly created him. I loved to hate Gollum.Is that woman who chafes at not being able to fight alongside the men a character from Tolkien's books? She's such a tedious action movie cliché – or would be if the actress playing her weren't so convincing and charming. She even ends up a genuine threat to a character who cannot die by any man, because of a technicality: she's not a man. That reminded me of the dreary moment in ""Jurassic Park"" when Helen Hunt cracks on Jeff Goldblum for talking about Man as if the term somehow excluded women. (Genesis: ""And God created Man, male and female."")I was very impressed with the special effects. Yes, they were awesome in themselves. But it's also impressive that they existed to tell the story – a rare feat these days when the story usually exists to service the effects. Still, the effects – while never overwhelming the story – sometimes overwhelmed themselves. Ebert gave special praise to the giant spider, but by the time it arrived I was already so sated with CGI monsters that this one didn't seem inordinately frightening. (Incidentally, Ebert says the spider scenes marked the best movie battle between giant insect and man, but these scenes – good as they are – don't replace the much lower-tech ""Them!"")I'm not in love with Peter Jackson's directing style. His camera is always sweeping around the scenery, which is almost invariably SFX-laden, as if to say, ""Nothing up my sleeve!""Viggo Mortensen is supposed to be a major star of this series, but he makes little impression on someone watching just this entry. Elijah Wood – with his enormous eyes and beguiling presence – feels like the protagonist. Orlando Bloom also has little to do, but unlike Mortensen he makes a bad impression. When we see him in closeup the only thought that seems to be roaming his mind is: ""Aren't I pretty?""What is it about some of these great old men of the theater – men like Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris – and here, Ian McKellan? One of them can just stand on screen for five seconds and even if you've never seen him before, you think, ""Wow, what a great actor.""Someone made a terrific comment on the message board for this movie, and it deserves to be read:""When anything becomes a 'craze' it tends to annoy those of us who enjoyed the material quietly and non-fanatically before it was a fad. When I was a young teen I actually had kind of a love-hate thing with George Lucas because when 'Star Wars' became popular it was suddenly 'cool' to like science fiction, and those of us who had liked it all along were assumed to be part of that herd.""I first read 'The Lord of the Rings' in my freshman year of high school (25 years ago now) and I have liked it ever since. I was glad to see the movies done, enjoyed them well, and plan to watch them again throughout the years. And though I suppose the advertising hype was necessary so the producers' gamble could pay off, I am glad it's over. Now the fad-of-the-month club people can move on to something else, and let me enjoy something I like in peace.""She was deriding both the people who obsessively love and abuse the movie. If the craze really is over, this might be a good time for a newbie to visit these movies. I saw this one, and despite my minor complaints, I loved it."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 April 2009~Good but massively over-rated!~A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.Most people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped.I find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all.CGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better.A great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD!Overall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending.Yes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~14 October 2022~This Movie WILL NEVER AGE!!!!!!~One of the best movies I have ever seen!! I recently revisited the Lord of the rings movies and this was the best of the three. The movie looks spectacular and the atmosphere is awesome. Peter Jackson did a brilliant job with these movies and this one is no different. Even to this day people remember this film and it truly is one of cinema's greatest movies of all time. It will go down as one of movies greatest trilogy and it will always stay close to mine and millions of peoples hearts.The acting is superb and the battles and action sequences are beyond comparison. The last battle and final minutes of the film are also really moving.BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~8 April 2004~Why did THIS one win the Oscar?~Fellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies, and the Academy snubbed it. The Two Towers was far less impressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is the weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best episodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third film. The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third book is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first movie, much less by the book. Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the movies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he took. It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of the first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but nowhere near great.Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle scenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in the previous two movies. The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith, the wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the Lord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably the finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate and detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of the battle. Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic scene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book without disappointing them  and it would have been very easy to go wrong at this point. And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with astonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic moments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed page. His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting of the beacons of Gondor are masterful.But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so disastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir and Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck. This is clearest in his revolting representation of Denethor. Jackson's Denethor is a cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly devoid of redeeming features. No man cut from this cloth could have lasted a month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors of Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control of a Palantir. The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood completely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more tragic, the crumbling of a brave man.Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to have no emotions of his own whatsoever. Granted, even in the books Gandalf seems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still had the old irritability and humor underneath. Arwen, after being used so well in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. Gimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still being used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately self-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer through last time.Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out. I will concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting with Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and something had to be cut. (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too, if he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well he did that sequence). But the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty seconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less than one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole book.That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done almost goes without saying. Art direction has been the one consistent strong point throughout this whole trilogy.In all, The Return of the King is a good movie. Certainly far worse ones have won Oscars. I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people imagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation: Go see it on a big screen. But watch The Fellowship of the Ring first.~0

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 December 2022~The most outstanding conclusion for a trilogy ever~As I said in the reviews for the previous two chapters, I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of ther reputation and many reviews. The first was great and a nice introduction, the second, while not outstanding, still good in some ways and the third... too great that it's a shame that you can't rate a movie with a score higher than 10, it's too damn perfect!After a prologue that shows us the origins of Gollum we join Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (Ian McKellen, Karl Urban, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom) that on the way to Isengard meet Merry and Tuc (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) that tell them about Treebeard that won against Saruman who is now imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf then goes to Denethor for preparing him for Sauron's attack but Denethor is insane because his son Boromir (Sean Bean) died: in the meanwhile Frodo, Samwise (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) and Gollum arrive to Minas Morgul where Gollum makes Frodo believe that Sam wants the precious ring, but Sam will save Frodo from a giant spider. After a long battle Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the army of the dead ogres arrive to Gondor, and now they don't have any other choice than go to Mordor, so that Frodo can go to Mount Doom for destroying the ring. Frodo is attacked by the ogres only to be saved by Sam, and can finally throw the ring in the lava despite a fight with Gollum. After the ring melts, the army or Mordor goes away and Sauron's spirit is defeated forever. Frodo and Sam are saved by the eagles and are taken to Gondor, and the day after in Minas Tirith there is the crowning of Aragorn as the new king and the celebration of his wedding with Arwen (Liv Tyler). In the end we see Bilbo finishing his book and Frodo decides to travel with the last elves left to Valinor.The sets are huge and spectacular at the same time, and the money was spent well for the scope. The performances by all (Mortensen, Bloom, Astin, Cate Blanchett, Wood, McKellen, Tyler and Rhys Davies) were all the great, and the soundtrack was on par with all the other settings. I especially loved the song OVER THE HORIZON by Annie Lennox towards the end credits, it was that great. The battle scenes and special effects were marvellous considering it was made in 2003.Overall, a must for fans of the trilogy and besides that, a masterpiece that has to be seen at least once for its greatness, it's that powerful!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~13 September 2019~Phenomenal~The Lord of the Rings is one of the most iconic, memorable movies in history, and it deserves a FAR BETTER overall rating than an 8.9.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~14 September 2019~Re-watched after a few years~As an avid Star Wars fan since the age of ten, I never thought anything could supplant the classic trilogy...but I was wrong. The Lord of the Rings with Return of the King as the grand finale, is truly the greatest film of all time. Watching this beloved classic has become a heartwarming and thrilling classic that never gets old, viewed year after year. I am emotionally and spiritually drained and uplifted every time. JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson have brought to life the most inspiring and enjoyable tale of all time. I have never before or since enjoyed a set of films as I have these. Beautiful and breath-taking beyond words, Lord of the Rings is the Masterpiece for the ages!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~24 September 2008~A fitting climax to a peerless cinematic legacy~"As the saying goes, ""All good things must come to an end"", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease.Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling ""GO AWAY, TROLL"" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance.The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen.Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can.-10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~19 August 2015~Jackson's crowning achievement~Just like the book it was based on, the third Lord of the Rings movie towers above its siblings and brings the series to a cataclysmic conclusion, in every sense of the word. From its gigantic battle sequences, to its heartbreaking personal moments, Return of the King redefines what is possible in cinema and sets the impossible bar every other masterpiece must be measured against from now on. Clocking in at almost 3 and a half hours in its theatrical cut, it covers most of the material in the book and wins every point for its immensely satisfying coda. Howard Shore gets another two Oscars and Jackson and co are finally paid their dues. I have never been happier on an Oscar night.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~9 August 2005~The greatest adventure film of all-time!~There is no epic like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I have never had a better time seeing this movie in theaters. This breathtaking epic, is the third and last installment in The Lord of the Rings. Sam and Frodo are closer and closer to the cracks of Doom while their journey becomes very dangerous along with their guide Gollum helping. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship try to stop Sauron's army from taking the ring. The movie is pure magical from beginning to end and the characters are all wonderful. Return of the King went very fast for a three and a half hour movie, mostly because I loved it. I have become very obsessed with the trilogy and if you loved the first two Lord of the Rings, you will definitely love the last one as well.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 February 2020~Return of the King starts strong...~...and although it loses steam in the middle, the spectacular battle, iconic design work and blistering finale pump it all up to the quality of its fore-films.The film is peppered with cool moments, a dawn raid against the archers of Osgiliath has a total dungeons and dragons feel and Gollum is such a schemer and a villain he's toe-curlingly watchable. The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake.Regarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~15 October 2017~An epic and spectacular climax to the greatest film trilogy ever created... just pure genius...~"What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life.Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion.And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling ""You Shall Not Pass!"", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a ""fantasy"" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~3 August 2005~From the beginning...~"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~13 December 2005~The end of an epic, unforgettable adventure~"It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: ""I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!"", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~22 March 2021~Best movie of all time!!~The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a masterpiece in visual storytelling and for me they are the greatest movies ever made. Especially this last one concludes the story so well, it has such an emotional impact and it doesn't feel as long as it is AT ALL. I love the characters so much and I can't imagine any movie ever topping this masterpiece of a film. 11/? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~19 December 2005~Thrilling, Gripping, Visually Exciting Conclusion to the Trilogy~"""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil.I came in fully expecting that the ""Return of the King"" aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early ""Star Wars"" movies.If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing.I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to ""LOTR: The Two Towers,"" but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his ""rally the troops"" a.k.a. ""another Crispin's Day speech,"" or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.(originally written 12/28/2003)"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~1 August 2005~A dazzling masterpiece~Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~23 March 2021~The most wonderful work of the seventh art~Trying to describe this masterpiece is overwhelming. No word would do justice to what it really is! Perfectly narrated, interpreted and expressed.The best movie ever seen!!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~11 October 2007~"The phrase ""Save the best for last"" has never been so evident."~"My Take: The best of the best. An unforgettable grand-scale epic.""This is it"", director Peter Jackson might have said. ""This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for."" Indeed, it is. The phrase ""Save the best for last"" has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch.The film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler.Director (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement.Here I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series.Rating: ***** out of 5."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 December 2003~Almost a masterpiece~LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~18 January 2006~Breathtaking~'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.The main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 June 2005~this is the best movie out of all three~Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable. Not a kid's movie.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~14 August 2013~As good as it gets!~Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect, if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time.Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there? If they do will they lose anybody else? What happens? Trust me watch this movie, along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~26 December 2020~An Epic Conclusion~Final film in Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic adventure dose not disappoint as Frodo and The Nine walkers tail comes to an end. If you haven't seen the first two films watch those first.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~15 September 2015~The definition of epic fantasy~The end of Middle-Earth draws near as the armies of orcs march against Minas Tirith, the great city of Gondor and the last bastion of Men, while at the same time Frodo and Sam have reached the borders of Mordor with their guide Gollum. Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.The Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.I also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.And yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.The Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's still easily one of my favourite movies, one of the finest epic movies ever made and more than worthy of all its praise.~9

Loved every single character in this movie, especially Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen and Arwen played by Liv Tyler.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 May 2005~The perfect example why should a trilogy filmed all together~I can't stop thinking how Lotr:TTT and Lotr:Rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.Maybe Peter Jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because The Two Towers and The Return Of The King lack the atmosphere of the first one.On the other hand maybe he could actually make them even better(History made me doubt this perspective).No one really knows .what we already know is that Jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.Way to go Mr Jackson!Now give us Silmarilion on screen too...? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~20 May 2018~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe third and finale film in The Lord of the Rings series is the best. Peter Jackson left the best for last in this epic of all epics. The scale of the film is huge and the battles and set pieces are massive. This film is a masterpiece that needs to be experienced. The ending is touching and brought chills.The acting is once again amazing.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 September 2014~Astounding~The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie, once again, the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other, and they're all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing, and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint. Definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~1 March 2020~The Greatest Fantasy Trilogy of All Time~I've lost count of how many times I've watched this gorgeous trilogy, every time I rewatch it I find something new.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~8 March 2022~A Masterpiece!!!~I still get goosebumps every time I watch this movie. I still at awe with how engaging the story is on screen, how good the visuals have held up even after all this time, and still get emotional with everything going on. It's a wonderful conclusion to an amazing trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and I wish for this movie to be cherished for years to come!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 May 2004~Perfect viewing (maybe at 11.00 at night!!!)~STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn the concluding adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy,Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) head with Gollum to Mount Doom to dispose of the troublesome ring,whilst the rest of the gang brace themselves for the final battle for Middle Earth.Having put my achy,fidgety,restless bum through the ordeal of the first two movies,I found it only fitting to watch the concluding part (which would be the longest part at a whopping 201 minutes!!!)Luckily,I happened to be watching this one on DVD as opposed to at the cinema and was therefore free to press the pause button at any moment I deemed appropriate in order to take a break and watch it entirely at my own pace.I would certainly only deem it advisable to watch this at a cinema that has a break for refreshments halfway through.I think my school of thought all along really has been that of a fair few others.If you were a fan of the books,then these movies will probably be the equivalent of a wet dream come to life.If you have never read any of the books,however,it's all likely to emerge as a big overblown,self indulgent affair,as I think sadly has been the case with me.The ending especially here is a real nerve grater,as it appears to come again and again after over three hours of patient sitting and observing,only to keep droning on that bit longer.Given the heavy handedness of it all anyway,it just makes for even more of a labourious experience.In the movie's favour,it is a bit more emotionally involving than the last two and manages to draw you in to the plot a bit more,although that may just be because you know a bit more what to expect and so you've resigned yourself to it that bit more.The battle scenes and cinematography in general are certainly nothing to sniff at either.This is,giving away from some laughable and not entirely convincing acting indeed.But,given how little the story had already engrossed me to this point,it's all a bit too little too late.It may have reached #4 on the IMDB top 100,but given I don't know a 'hobbit from a racehorse',it's best use in my favour would seem to be as the ultimate late-night cure for insomnia.**~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~21 January 2004~Wonderful finale, sweeping emotions and action~"Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like ""gets everything right"", and ""I enjoyed every minute of it"", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving ""Into the West"" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends. The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored.If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet: As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~7 April 2022~tolkien is a legend!~Every time I read that a series or movie cannot fully or somewhat faithfully translate a book, I am reminded of the LOFTR movies a great adaptation of a great literary classic, the atmosphere and the plot are well outlined and well adapted for the film, great performances, beautiful cinematography, beautiful scenery, beautiful music for me the LOFRT trilogy is ALMOST PERFECT.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~26 January 2015~An epic conclusion to an epic saga~I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my father's favorite movie. Back then, I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then, but I liked it.Entering High School, I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again, and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien, created a beautiful world, and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters' growth as we followed their journey up to the end.The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time.The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth, having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film, it was done just right.This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece.~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~9 November 2009~Along Came a Spider~"""The final battle for Middle-earth begins as Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the 'One Ring'. Aragorn struggles to fulfill his legacy as he leads his outnumbered followers against the growing power of the Dark Lord Sauron, so that the Ring-bearer may complete his quest,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, this final installment was the ""Winner of 11 'Academy Awards'.""The conclusion of writer/director Peter Jackson's majestic realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's good versus evil epic adventure ""The Lord of the Rings"" continues to inspire awe; ""The Return of the King"" is another state-of-the-art motion picture, with the expected mind-blowing special effects and battle scenes. As you'll see (or not), this chapter falters somewhat, after the more tightly-constructed ""Two Towers"". But, at this point, criticism is pointless. In conclusion:******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis********* The Return of the King (12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd********* The Lord of the Rings (12/10/01-12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen"~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~2 November 2010~Superelf to the rescue...~I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot. And it isn't.Oh well, fingers crossed for The Hobbit...~8

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~1 April 2007~Very, VERY good.~It's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my number one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. ) There's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes, though. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't recommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~22 January 2005~The problem with imagination~"Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~28 May 2007~the journey may have ended, but the legacy will live on~"And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were spectacular achievements. ""Return of the King"" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film ""Titanic"".""Return of the King"" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points.The Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as ""Star Wars"". ""Return of the King"" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~20 February 2006~"Yes! The last of the ""LotR"" series, and this one's the best!"~"Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs, including all the original versions of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I liked part 1: ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and part 2: ""The Two Towers"" was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with ""The Godfather: Part II"" taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh? It also shows that the three parts had a connection which flowed very nicely: starting at the bottom, then going up to the climax, and then going back down again.Before you watch this movie, I must warn you that this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long! Here's my plan: watch a part a day; this will make watching ""Lord of the Rings"" more exciting! And be sure that you're watching the original movies first. If you like DVDs and watching action films, then these movies are right for you."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~30 June 2009~Jackson makes best of three with smart appreciation of entertainment~Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their quest for Mordor to destroy the one ring while the Battle for Middle Earth rages on.The final part of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy was at the time, the highest grossing film ever to grace our screens and up until this film, fan hype and speculation was rightfully anticipating how the magician Jackson would conclude the wonderfully courageous adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novel.The previous release, The Two Towers, was showcased by an eccentric display by the director, orchestrating a once more beautifully cinematic approach to scenery and balancing it with a blend of tight and exciting war and fantasy concepts. He proved The Fellowship was no fluke and maintaining his flow in the sequel, the New Zealander was able to carry forth this momentum into the final part with the same vigour and energy as his previous two smashes. There are certainly cases here for the best shots of the entire trilogy. When Frodo is walking slowly and there is a huge spider looming makes great tension but, on a personal level, the best part of the entire series comes near to the end when Frodo and Sam are so very close to banishing the ring for good, and with one simple close shot, Jackson captures Frodo's feelings of desire and madness, which makes for a heart stopping and riveting twist.Peter Jackson has certainly taken the magic of the novels and twisted and shot them into fan's favourites. The complexity of the battle sequences, the close eye upon constant political and action ideologies and weaving a tight knot around such a huge crew is a fantastic achievement and is only bettered by the fact he has made the legendary books into films for anyone of any age, for anytime of the year and for any situation. There is humour, romance, action, war, drama and significantly a wonderful sense of escapism with the fantasy genre, astounding stuff to recapture the critically acclaimed mind of J.R.R Tolkien's work.One huge input into the success which still has fans in awe is the CGI Andy Serkis who blew audiences away with that voice and self manipulation. Smeagol opens proceedings here as his friend discovers the one ring at the bottom of the lake. Up to this stage we are fully aware of the ring's pull over Gollum, but there is a delightful shock in store when the real Andy Serkis sets his eyes upon it in his friend's hand. A wonderfully cut montage sees Gollum up the present and his still changing debate over how his master affects him.Like the previous two films, there are multiple stories with the fellowship in the battle for Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam on their quest whilst there are numerous activities in the different parts of the country. The multiple concepts and issues flying around are smartly condensed into manageable moments of brilliance. Jackson has easily made the best of the three here, and rightfully and finally clinched his Oscar.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~10 February 2020~Most of low ratings are by purpose!~How can you give one of the greatest movies in cinema history a 1 or 2 rating? Yes if you are a GOT fan or marvel fan you can do that! By purpose only for bringing your sily movies upper on the list.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~25 October 2004~Steaming...~The Lord of the Rings Trilogy reminds me of something with which I am quite familiar as a long-time denizen of Central New York: a steaming pile of horse manure. You know, that sickly sweet smell, wafting across hills on a summer breeze. Some people find the scent pleasant. I disagree.Likewise with LOTR. It seems Peter Jackson confused everyone into thinking that this series was something epic, something gargantuan, something important. Really, though, it's not. Yes, it is epic and it's long too, but it's not an important cinematic event. In fifty years, I dare say it'll be forgotten along with Titanic. You remember that plate of tripe, don't you? No, by the time I'm lying prostrate on a hospital bed, these three movies will have long been expunged from my memory and the memories of most others.You see, Mr. Jackson somehow forgot to concoct an interesting story when he drafted his endless (and often excruciatingly dull) battle scenes. There is, really, no character development to speak of. Frodo and Sam remain one-dimensional throughout and what depth Jackson gives them is cursory. And the rest? I have a difficult time keeping them straight.I'm sorry, Ringies, this movie just isn't that good. Maybe it's the glossy coating. See, I love Star Wars and, to be fair, many of the criticisms I've leveled against LOTR could also be leveled against George Lucas' films. Oh, and when I say Star Wars, I speak of the original trilogy. Yet, for all it's craftsmanship, the original Star Wars films were sort of clunky. You could tell that they were models made by hand, sets made by hand, costumes made by hand. It looked like a B-movie and felt like a B-movie and it was a B-movie, albeit one with great set design, costumes, effects, etc. LOTR really is a B-movie as well. Or at least it would have been 50 years ago. Yet, in today's market, it gets gussied up, made into an A-picture and it doesn't deserve it. I'm sorry, I just don't find this movie all that good and you'll never convince me otherwise.5/10 - Three points for tree-beard or whatever his name is and two for the ambition to even film it.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~8 January 2004~My brief review of the film~The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.~4
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~30 May 2004~Best Picture of the Year? Give me a break..~"Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****"~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 September 2016~awards winning epic~Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~15 April 2021~A Masterpiece~I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old. It was New Year's Eve. I sat next to my PC, brought a whole bottle of white wine for some reason and watched the whole trilogy until the morning. Needless to say I also got drunk for the first time. Best experience ever :D.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~29 July 2023~Still a masterpiece!~After years and years of rewatching the best trilogy of all time, I can only say that it was a pity that the extended versions where not in the cinema. Would really enjoy at one point a LOTR marathon in cinema with the extended version. It is amazing what kind of effects and storytelling was put in place for this movie and the whole series together. I can only hope that at one point in time at least another movie like this one, not saying a trilogy, will be done so we can enjoy a true marvelous movie with a grand story and characters. Chapeau to everyone from staff to directors!Other than that, still unbeatable!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~22 February 2004~Tried Way Too Hard To Be Profound~The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~27 March 2007~IMDb's Number FIVE?~"Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again."~6
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~23 November 2006~best film of the decade~"as you see in the title, you can see it was a great film. i have only had the DVD for 2 weeks and i got a 2 disc DVD for £2.99. wow you might think.well back to the film, and this is a film whose without its amazing and stunning fights/wars, would be a OK film but wouldn't be a classic. when the battles begin, you can't stop watching- even if your mum asks you to tidy up. the scenes with the horses and their warriors galloping is breath taking and makes you want to re enact it as i'm a 13 year old boy, this was a film which you want to re enact and talk about.it fills you with thrill which is a very special thing to do. when people saw this, people were like, ""wow what an amazing film!"" and ""it's so good, i want to see it again and again!""i think this film was done by the right people and acted by the right people you couldn't image anyone for the roles. Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~4 January 2004~Sweet dreams, everyone.~"Well, it's finally over: Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance. How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears? how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles? how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf? how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield? how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)? how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense?? (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win? that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone. (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.) Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for ""special editions"" of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater: what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see. ""Extended-edition DVD's"" don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb. I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!"" But that's precisely my point. *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book: it's too long; it's too unwieldy. As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*: the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues. Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix* or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the ""action-adventure"" genre. But to say so is not to say much. The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly. It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake. In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by: but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire. It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels. Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin: what, was *Ulysses* chopped liver? What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it. I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor. Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line. While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,"" I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into: in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower. Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp, but it's still a pretty lame villain. Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material. In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity. Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain. But don't fret: Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition. In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone."~3
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King~6 March 2004~is everybody crazy?~"I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three. I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning. I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful. Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness. Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief. The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question. Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background. It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive. Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake. Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from. Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes. Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops. Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right? They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long. The songs were good. The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent. Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies. The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace. ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT. And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good. *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy. Gak! Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this."~5
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 March 2006~First, And Still The Best Of LOTR~"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 April 2006~The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension~"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~15 February 2020~Great~It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure, the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep, but for an absolute masterpiece like this, it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!? ~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 March 2021~How the hell did they film this thing~An incredible feat Enthrals anew every time Cannot believe its two decades ago Love it so much? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 May 2002~An absolutely incredible film!~Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 November 2014~Thank you Mr Jackson~(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 June 2019~An amazing beginning of the trilogy. An amazing end of the movie.~"""For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.""GaladrielGaladriel tells Hobbits may look like unimportant people but they will change the course of the future. Story begins with this line.This line is not really the first line but the line stars the movie for real. This movie is breathtaking. Whatever I say is not enough for this trilogy. Brilliant novel, brilliant adapted screenplay.Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup, breathtaking visual effects, stunning cinematography. The trilogy nearly succeed at all technical subjects."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 December 2001~Wow!~Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~30 November 2007~Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved~"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement.This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring.This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse.For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization.The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package.The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~8 October 2002~Embrace the magic~It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 June 2002~Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film~For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears. The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages. NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right. The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters. This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 August 2005~From the beginning...~"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 August 2002~A Masterpiece~"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 March 2006~I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better~I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 January 2002~Excellent~"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on. All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie. The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused. I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real. All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking. The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by. The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating). It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids. Still, it's the best film of 2001. SEE IT!!!!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~13 August 2022~Absolute game changer~Absolutely epic! The scale is truly mind blowing. Every filmmaking aspect is beyond incredible. Especially the score, set design & dialogue. The emotional weight & amazing battles seal it.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 February 2006~A truly exceptional film~There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 January 2002~Never read the book, but loved the movie!~I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters. I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well. I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended. I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick. That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it. If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book. And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 June 2021~RPG Game: The Movie~I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~27 March 2002~Don't care what the Academy says, Best film of 2001 and best of many others.~LOTR is without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 January 2022~One ring and three movies to rule them all.~It took me 14 years and a subscription to HBO Max to get around to watching this movie, and I can certainly say it was worth every bit of hype it gets. The Fellowship of the Ring was an epic start and one of the best fantasy adventure films I've ever seen. These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~17 February 2002~Middle Earth comes alive...in breathtaking detail.~"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy. But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie. I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story. It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience. Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen. Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it. Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real. Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same. The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters. All I can say is, ""Wow."" I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least. Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits. He also cries like a little girl. But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character. The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too. Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling. Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding. He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting. Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change. In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are. Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas. Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style. He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film. Gimli was pompous and brave, as well. He is well-represented in the movie. Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong. Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior. Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond. He was noble and cold at the same time. And Gandalf. What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard? He was magnificent. He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children. Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places. Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water. Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings."""~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 April 2022~We May Have Forgotten Just How Good This Is~It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 July 2020~A brilliant start to this epic trilogy~The Lord of the Rings trilogy is prpbably the best trilogy to ever exist. Every film is absolutely perfect and it all started with The Fellowship of the Ring.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring follows a Hobbit and eight companions who go on an adventure to destroy the powerful One Ring and ultimately defeat Sauron.The Fellowship of the Ring sets the LOTR trilogy to a terrific start. This is one of the films I wish I saw in theatres as the large scale of it make it a cinematic experience. Peter Jackson directs this film with all his might. Absolutely stunning camerawork enhance J.R.R. Tolkien's magnificent creation of Middle-earth and fully immerses the audience into that world. Seeing the Fellowship as they come over the mountain with Howard Shore's epic score playing over it just made me leap with joy. This film is three hours long but it never feels like that. The grand size of this world along with its characters and story keeps you engaged till the end. That shows how good the editing and pacing is. There is not one single boring moment.If that wasn't enough, the performances are sure to win you over. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo. What is left to say about Ian McKellan as Gandalf. He's simply iconic. Viggo Mortenson is legendary, Sean Astin and Sean Bean are fantastic. The entire ensemble cast is simply outstanding.The Fellowship of the Ring concludes the first chapter of the trilogy in a very satisfying way. The characters, the visuals, Howard Shore's epic score, the performances and Peter Jackson's tremendous direction make this a cinematic masterpiece.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~6 February 2020~Perfect Film.~Focus on the fantastic artistic synthesis of concerning hobbits and the founding of the fellowship in a post 9/11 world.Exquisite in every way. Important. And treated with respect and seriousness.There is not one scene in the extended edition that I would remove and that doesn't feel appropriately sandwiched.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~17 February 2002~Visual marvel~"The storyline in the ""Lord of the Rings"" is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done. But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb. Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts. The backdrops are excellent. There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well. A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that. Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy. In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this. But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING. Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind. Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film.10 out of 10."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 December 2005~Embrace the power of the Ring...~"I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad...That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called ""theatrical versions""): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others.As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the N°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time.An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay).One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~17 December 2014~thirteen years on, still one of the greatest fantasy films ever made~Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~30 January 2002~Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...~"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~8 January 2020~The start of something epic~The word 'epic' probable gets used too much these days to describe films. However, in this case it's definitely right. For those two people out there who don't know, 'The Lord of the Rings' is (primarily, excluding various 'spin-off' books) a trilogy of long books set in a fiction world called 'Middle Earth' which is filled with everything from wizards to dragons (yes, think 'Game of Thrones,' but with less nudity.It had long been considered that J. R. R. Tolkien's books were 'unfilmable' due to no screen adaptation being able to bring his lavish world to life (properly). There was an animated attempt (which wasn't as bad as people made out), but due to budgetary reasons, it was left unfinished (a concept which left me particularly confused when I watched it as a child). However, now the source material has finally been given the big screen treatment it deserved and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the start of the trilogy's life in mainstream cinema.Despite the long backstory (shown in a brief montage/history lesson at the beginning of the film) all you need to know is that the spirit of a 'dark lord' wants his magic ring back in order to become whole again and generally take over the land. However, by luck the piece of jewellery in question is in the hands of a gentle race of little creatures known as 'hobbits.' They, together with an assortment of men, wizards, dwarfs and elves, vow to prevent the dark lord Sauron from getting his property back and set off on a quest to destroy it in the fires of the volcano where it was once forged.I suppose you could call the cast an 'ensemble.' With a story that requires so many characters, quite a few familiar faces will pop up. Primarily you have Sir Ian McKellen as the iconic wizard, Gandalf the Grey, but he's backed up by everyone from Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee to Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen. In fact it's more a case of the more 'famous' Hollywood actors are secondary to the two hobbits who are at the centre of the tale, Frodo and Sam, plays by Elijah Wood and Sean Aston respectively. They're possibly less well-known that the affore-mentioned actors and yet rise to the challenge and prove that they're more than capable of having a major cinematic franchise rest on their (miniature!) shoulders.The cast is perfectly surrounded by some of the best sets, scenery and special effects ever to be committed to the big screen at the time (yes, you can - sort of - see a bit of 'green screen' work these days, but they still hold up!). Some say that the whole trilogy is one giant advert for the New Zealand tourist board, as it makes use of all the country's different landscapes to great effect.Of course seeing as 'Fellowship' is the first in a trilogy, there a certain amount of 'set up' contained where some story threads are mentioned but never expanded on - yet. However, this never really stops anyone from understanding what's going on and I'm sure once you watch this installment you'll want to know where it all goes!I know that the real 'Tolkien purists' will argue about which bits from the book have either been left out, or slightly changed, like making an Elf maiden an outright warrior in the film. I've read the books and, due to their length, it would probably be impossible to commit every last page to screen (unless you make every film about six hours!) and what they've done is taken all the most important points and used them to great effect to make the story as accessible to as many people as possible.I think it was writer/director Kevin Smith who said in 'Clerks II' that the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was just basically 'people walking.' Okay, so funny as that may be (and - technically - true) there's so much more to the film that just that. The best part about 'Fellowship' (and indeed the whole trilogy) is that it can be enjoyed by most people, not just fans of the book or the genre, but also appreciated by (nearly) everyone with an eye for good cinema due to its achievements in world-building and sheer scale.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 March 2016~The beginning of one of the greatest sagas of contemporary cinema.~"Based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings,"" one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover.Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done.It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~10 March 2017~A Worthy Heir To Tolkien's Masterpiece~"Adapting a novel for the big screen is never easy, as the printed-word format is often quite expansive and not easily pared down to suit the necessities of the big screen. Now, try that transition with perhaps the most well-known fantasy novel of all-time. That was the task director Peter Jackson faced while creating ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Not only does he succeed, but he does so on perhaps the highest possible level. ""Fellowship"" is truly one of the greatest book-to-film transitions ever attempted.For a very basic overview, this films establishes the legacy of the One Ring of Power and the fellowship put together to protect/destroy it. The ring, initially possessed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), is passed down to nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) who begins his trek to destroy it by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was created. Joining Frodo on his journey are...-Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen) -Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) -Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) -Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Bolomir (Sean Bean) of the Realm of Men -Fellow Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), & Pippin (Billy Boyd)The scale of this endeavor--even just this first installment--is perhaps unmatched in the entirety of cinema. Unlike some high-aiming adaptations that might pull punches or cut corners, this is an ""all-in"" effort from the get-go. From costuming to music, location, acting, and special effects, you'll hardly feel like you're watching a movie. Instead, you will essentially be living within it. That is how expertly Jackson captures the realms of Middle Earth.Obviously, J.R.R. Tolkien (original writer of the novel trilogy) crafted a story in LOTR that will be passed down through the generations. But Jackson accomplishes just as monumental a feat. While cutting and trimming here and there to make the long tomes work in a cinematic setting, there is very little lost in the change-over. The books I was utterly captivated by as an adolescent are--rather improbably--equaled here.As such, I consider ""Fellowship"" an extraordinary film to kick off the LOTR trilogy on the big screen. In hindsight, if the trilogy can be evaluated as standalone efforts, it is probably the best of the bunch. As the closing credits roll and the promise of further adventure beckons, you are almost guaranteed to feel two things: an intense desire to dive into ""The Two Towers"", and the overwhelming knowledge that an incredible book has been miraculously transformed into a never-to-be-outdone film."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~1 September 2003~The Best Movie of Fantasy and Adventure Ever Made~In my opinion this is the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~22 December 2001~Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film~"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it. After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"". In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with. In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema. The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals. It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating. It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story. He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed. Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman), and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo. I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode. Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold. In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging. Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character. And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc. He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character. Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood. Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary. He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough. See this film! Greatest film ever made? How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written. Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it. One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 July 2002~A Matter of Visions~"Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~8 July 2002~Three Rings for the Elven Kings, Under The Sky........~I wish I could quote the whole poem. The Lord of the Rings is, far and away, the BEST MOVIE OF 2001!!! And #2 of all time!!! Right behind the Star Wars trilogy (which I count as one movie) and right above the Longest Day. The movie does it's best to follow the books (and cuts out several pointless parts) and is just as I pictured it. AMZING acting, UNBELEAVIBLE fx, AND ALL AROUND ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 10/10!!! and I only resurve that for the BEST the most FLAWLESS of movies!!!

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 December 2021~An Epic Film that beings the book to life~So with the Lockdown back in effect I thought it was time to get started on re watching The Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit Films so yesterday I watched The Fellowship Of The Ring and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of companions from different races have to come together to travel to a dark land to destroy a powerful ring and stop the dark lord Sauron.Main Character Elijah Wood plays Frodo Baggins a Hobbit who is tasked with carrying the ring and he is great here. You really get the feeling that Frodo is out of his depth on the quest but Wood does a good job in making him likeable and you really want to see him succeed in his quest. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and he is brilliant here, he is such a physical actor here and he nails all the action scenes that he is given. He is also a really interesting character, I mean you are given bits and pieces in this film to keep you interested, but not giving you too much right off the bat.Supporting Characters There are so many characters in this film and everybody is great but I will only talk about a few of them in greater detail. Sir Ian McKellen plays Gandalf The Grey and he is awesome here, Gandalf is so wise and McKellen nails it as the wise, fun and action heavy wizard that is a real mentor figure to the rest of The Fellowship and does it effectively. Sean Bean plays Boromir and he is also a really interesting character here, he has a bit of a darker personality then the other characters but he gives a very memorable performance. Sir Christopher Lee plays Saruman The White and of course he is fantastic, he is a legend and a hue Lord Of The Rings fan so of course he is great in the role, Saruman is another really interesting cog of the film and his dynamic with Gandalf is fascinating to watch. As I said everybody is great, Orlando Bloom is great, Cate Blanchett is great, Sean Astin is great and the whole group is just so great and one of the greatest ensembles of all time.Story The story is great, it brings you into this world as we follow these people come together on this epic quest. The characters and their connection together is what drives the film forward and you will end up caring about all of them throughout, it has a simple good vs evil but layers it with so much depth to make this a great journey. The film may be 3 hours long but the story stays interesting throughout and moves at a really nice pace to keep you intrigued for every minute of the film.Script The script is great, it takes this fantastical world and gives us interesting and down to earth characters that we can look up to and care about. This is obviously a very dramatic film and it nails all of that but it is the humour too that makes this script legendary. You can go from drama to humour and it feels really natural and helps build the world and the characters up.Style The style of the film is amazing, the landscapes of New Zealand where it was filmed it as beautiful as ever which is advanced by some legendary cinematography mixed with Howard Shore's epic score that just brings you into Middle Earth. Even though the film is 3 hours long it is paced perfectly and as I mentioned before keeps you invested throughout with some great action scenes.Overall Overall, The Fellowship Of The Ring is one of the greatest films ever made, if you haven't seen this film then find not only 3 hours but nine hours to watch all of these films, heck maybe watch the extended editions but do it whenever you can as it is a must watch.Rating - 10/10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 January 2022~The First Installment of the Greatest Trilogy~The beginning of the greatest trilogy started with the Fellowship. The music, the landscapes, the characters, and of course the story, all come together in perfect melody. Tolkien created this magical world and story, but Jackson brought it to us in a way we never thought possible. And the best part was... there were two more movies after this.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 November 2014~The greatest fantasy film of all-time~An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.**** (out of four)~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 July 2022~The most consistent film trilogy ever.~I finish my rewatch, and then i think of something about this movie and i have to rewatch the whole trilogy again. I swear, I could rewatch the extended editions over and over again. This is the perfect start to an amazing trilogy.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 April 2006~Epic, sweeping film-making at it's very best~"The Fellowship of the RingWhen one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term ""quality"", in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere.It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score.Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time.Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while.-10/10"~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 July 2020~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring)~One of the best films I've watched is a great movie. By the word, I highly recommend watching it? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 July 2002~A truly great movie, whether you're a fantasy fan or not~"I knew from the first time I saw the preview that this was a movie that I wanted to see. Now, I have never picked up a Tolkien book, and the only story I ever knew was the Hobbit, and that was from the animated movie.Now, let me make my observations of some of the reviews listed here, and I must say that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and here is mine. If you don't like this movie, pronouncing it as boring and too long, then you obviously don't have the patience to watch a great movie, more like you love the hacked off 88 min movie that has no real script to speak of, and only took 2 months to film. Which is fine, because I like those movies as well,but also I personally love a movie that took a lot of work, and is also very spectacular as a result. Titanic comes to mind, for one. I want substance in a movie, and LotR delivers. It is a true work of art, unlike (someone mentioned ""Fight Club"" ???? A classic?! I think not). If you only thought of it as boring, then you were only looking for action and no story, in which case the latest Van Damme movie would have fulfilled your expectations.What I truly loved about this movie wasn't just the scenery, but the acting as well. Each part was brought to life perfectly, and the actors had great chemistry together. I especially loved Ian as Gandalf, and I must also give a great nod to Christopher Lee, who has always made a great villain. The action was well placed and suspenseful, and everything looked as I would expect a fantasy world to look like.Overall a very well made movie. If you hate it, then maybe it's over your head."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 February 2022~Late to the game, but what an epic epoch!~I watched the extended version of a meager 3.5 hours. Having seen snippets of the movie when it came out on DVD and friends were watching it, I couldn't be bothered. I had read so many fantasy books over the years, and generally I tended to be disappointed by any novel that was made into a movie, for instance most of the adapted masterpieces written by Stephen King are mediocre at best; Only later I was able to enjoy adaptations, first one that comes to mind is Birdy with Nicholas Cage.Back to Fantasy, I had given Tolkien a try when I was too young, collapsing under its' volume. Later I reread it and loved it, so given the effort I put into it, I didnt wat it to be tainted by a sub par undertaking. And yes the raving reviews were pretty much in my face, but when time goes on, well, you know... That.So now, in 2022 I took the time to watch it, be it in parts as I don't have 3.5 hours to spare anymore unfortunately, and it was overwhelmingly beautiful! It is so long and there is so much to tell, that it borders on tedious at times, but the investment is so big you have to finish, you can't let it go! And the payoff is massive, and I have to say the most human among the fellowship, the human played by Sean Bean, brought tears to my eyes. I even had to gasp for air, what a performance! Amazingly well done.Over 20 years later, and the movie is still rock solid, nothing waned, not the visual effects, not the vision of all the different worlds, nothing looks out of whack, but spot on and suspending disbelief is not a thing at all, throughout the entire length of the movie. You are there, with them.I have to tip my hat to Peter Jackson, and curse him at the same time. If the other two parts are as well done, I'm afraid I will have a massive sleep deprivation issue once done.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~22 March 2002~Best film of 2001.~I think this is the best film of 2001. As an avid fan of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, I was excited to see these being made into films. I was not disappointed by the movie which followed the books pretty faithfully without getting too long and drawn out. All of the acting was great and the special effects well-done. I cannot wait to see the 2nd and 3rd films.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 July 2002~An epic worthy of it's hype~The long awaited live action adaption of the classic Tolkein novel Lord of the Rings more than justified the massive hype surrounding it. Simply put, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have not been so utterly blown away by a film in a long time like I was when I saw this. Every, and I mean every, aspect of this film is executed flawlessly. The ensemble performances are truly fantastic, especially by Wood and McKellan. All I can say is I can't wait for it to be released on DVD and I can't wait for The Two Towers and Return of the King to come to theatrical release. I think we have finally seen the arrival of a trilogy that matches the magnitude of the original Star Wars trilogy. 10/? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 April 2020~The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)~"""One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all And in the darkness bind them""Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of ""The Lord of the Rings"" just fly by.It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 July 2002~Brilliant, my third favorite film ever.~"I have seen ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". It looks just as amazing as the first just from the previews. If you have not seen this, go see it NOW. In a theatre or when it arrives on DVD and VHS. 10.0/10.0 A classic"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 July 2021~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~There can be little doubt that the Lord of the Rings film are the greatest trilogy of all time. At the time of writing the films sit on the top 250 at 7th, 10th, and 14th. No other trilogy is so highly rated. The Godfather Part III is nowhere to be seen on the Top 250.Peter Jackson + Howard Shore + The the amazing actors (every single one was absolutely brilliant, from Elijah Wood to Marton Csokas. Not to mention all the stunt doubles, special effects team, editors all all others who made this film/these films what they are. And a special thanks to the country of New Zealand for being so very beautiful!This is my favourite film of all time, no doubt about it, there are no criticisms that I believe are valid!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 October 2010~A very solid start to a great trilogy~J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox~9

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~1 September 2022~An Absolute Epic~"Let's take a moment and consider what a risk this was for New Line Cinema. It's the late 90's early 2000's and Peter Jackson comes in and wants over 100 million dollars to make a fantasy movie. Peter Jackson, a director whose previous credits include ""The Frighteners"" and ""Bad Taste"". Fantasy films were seen at the time as box office poison. Lord of the Rings was seen as a book that could not be adapted. It had a loyal fanbase, but the film adaptations had already tried and failed to bring in a return. And Jackson was wanting to film 3 movies altogether at once. This pitch must have sounded crazy. Thankfully for all involved they gave the greenlight and we got this wonderful film.This is the go to fil as an example of grand fantasy epic. The cinematography and effects are breathtaking, letting the audience grasp the huge scope of the adventure. The music by Howard Shore is pitch perfect, conveying triumph, mystery, sorrow and any emotion needed for the time. Although magical and mysterious, the film seamlessly explains the stakes and story to the audience. The action scenes are all well shot and the quest always feels like it is going forward.Along with the technical aspects of music and editing, what really holds this film together are the characters. All 9 members of the fellowship are casted and acted perfectly. All the characters the fellowship come across do a fantastic job. Christopher Lee as Saruman, that is the role this man was born to play. They bring these literary characters to life in such a way that I can't picture anyone else in the role.Compared to the other two films in the epic trilogy, this one is the most focused. As the films go on, the storyline will get split into the different side quests of the groups. But in this first one, save for cutting to Saruman, the story focuses primarily on the adventure of our fellowship. This is also the only one of the trilogy that has Enya do the end credits song, clearly all the other movies could have benefited from doing the same.I'm not sure what more I can add to the conversation that hasn't been said before. There is no other movie with such a long runtime that I have watched as often as Lord of the Rings. Prepare yourself for the adventure of a lifetime, the one fantasy film to rule them all."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 July 2008~Excellent adventure~"Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb ""Top 250"" list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 December 2009~I was not in the target audience~I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 April 2004~A Glorious Vision of Middle Earth~"The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~1 September 2022~A true achievement in film.~"Peter Jackson adores DVD. He knew going in to his daring translation of Tolkien's fantasy that it wouldn't stop at the cinema. The idea of a finished film can be fluid: scenes excised for valid reasons can be reinstated for home consumption. So, for DVD, not a 'director's cut' replacing the theatrical version, but an alternative extended edit. Put back into the film seamlessly, the extra half-hour of footage doesn't denigrate the original cut, but enhances it like an encore. The tone and story don't change; the journey is deepened, even if the momentum slows. Book-devotees especially will delight in the re-inclusion of Bilbo's voiceover on bucolic Hobbit culture, the extension of Aragorn's backstory, and the small additions on the other members of the Fellowship. If any section feels improved, it is Lothlorien with Cate Blanchett's Galadriel: here we get the famous gift-giving sequence which will prove significant, in the films to come, while the thematic weight of the Elvish decline grows more prominent. Nothing is lost and plenty is gained - this Special Extended Edition DVD is precious indeed. ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination. Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging."~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 April 2002~W.O.W.~"WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always?Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals ""Harry Potter"", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED ""Harry Potter"" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 January 2002~Heroic Fellowship~"Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read ""The Hobbit"" way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style.The narrative at the movie's beginning was necessary for a novice like myself. The One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron must be destroyed or all will be lost in Middle-earth. The Ring possesses great power and the seductive power of evil. The Ring that has been lost for 2500 years ends up in the hands of Hobbit, Frodo (Elija Wood). The powerful wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) recognizes the Ring for what it is. Frodo's charge is to destroy the Ring. Soon a Fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest. There are Elves, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Orcs, and Humans along the way. The journey is filled both with bravery and betrayal. Gandalf's master, Saruman (Christopher Lee), has aligned himself with Lord Sauron. The Ranger, Strider (Viggo Mortensen), becomes the protector of the brave Frodo. The first hour moves very slow under the weight of the material and set up. The last two hours of the movie move briskly. This is a very stuffed 3 hour movie that does not feel longer than that, or shorter.What makes ""Fellowship of the Rings"" so captivating is it's tale of heroes and great warriors. Elija Wood does an amazing job in the transformation of Frodo. At first Frodo is overwhelmed by the responsibility he undertakes, then he sees that he must do what is right, and he realizes that he is not alone. Wood combines the anxiety and courage magically. Ian McKellan is awesome as Gandalf. As the powerful and aging wizard he is the leader that inspires greatness in others. Viggo Mortensen as Strider/ Aragorn is charismatic, and the soul of the ""Fellowship."" Strider is a great warrior and a true samurai. Strider gives his word to Frodo that he will protect him with his life, and he keeps his word. Mortensen plays Strider as man of few words, backed up by action, compassion, and seemingly haunted by a dark secret. He absolutely commands the screen. Also impressive are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the Elf archer, and Sean Bean as the warrior Boromir, who battles the seductive power of the Ring. Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as Galadriel, the muse of this Fellowship. Liv Tyler is beautiful as Arwen, though she does have much of a role in this installment.Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful storytelling with great performances from a very talented cast. I look forward to rest of the movies."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 February 2002~More, more. I want more.~I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more. This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films. Thank you, Peter. I am hungrily awaiting the next two.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 December 2021~With stellar performances, beautiful cinematography, haunting epic music, and it's regards to the source material, The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start after 10 years~Based on the first installment of the trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story about a dark lord named Sauron who created the powerful ring that would rule all of Middle Earth. Despite the dark lord being destroyed, the spirit of the ring lived on for ages until one day, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit leaves the Shire and leaves the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. However, Sauron's army seeks to find the One Ring and kill anyone who carries it. Aided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, three hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin along with Aragorn, a strider, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, and Boromir of Gondor, the group set off on a journey to Mount Doom and send the One Ring back to the fires where it was created.When I was a kid I was only into cartoons and then I came across the 1978 cartoon from Ralph Bakshi when it was on video (only parts of it until I saw the whole thing when it was on Cartoon Network) Later, when I was a teenage, I finally got into watching the trilogy and needless to say, I was blown away. This film is not only a great start to the trilogy but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not to mention that it got me into reading the book trilogy which is well written full of beautiful world building, great characters, an interesting lore surrounding Middle Earth, and engrossing action.The story is great and keeps up with the spirit of the source material. Not only that, it has emotional moments and great action sequences while having some character depth. The pacing while slow is very lively, the editing is superb, the directing from Peter Jackson is solid, and the cinematography is very gorgeous. Even the costumes are well designed.The music score from Howard Shore is great. Epic haunting, and sad which gives a neat atmosphere to the film especially the themes of Middle Earth and the characters as well. And last but not least the actors.Acting-wise, everyone gives a stellar performance. The late actors Christopher Lee and Ian Holm did great as Saruman the wizard who gathers Sauron's forces and Bilbo Baggins the hobbit who got possessed by the ring for a long time. The other actors did a great job too. Ian McKellen did fantastic as Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortensen did stellar as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom and John Rhy Davies did great as Legolas and Gimli, Sean Bean did a nice job as the corrupted Boromir, Liv Tyler and Hugo Heaving did great as Arwen and Lord Elrond, and the actors who played the hobbits did a stellar job too.Elijah Wood as the vulnerable hobbit Frodo, Sean Astin as his loyal friend Sam, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan did great as Pippin and Merry who share some nice humor while providing some loyalty too.Overall The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and a solid adaptation of the book. It's been 20 years since it came out in the US.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~9 August 2005~Brilliant and Intelligent~For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 February 2002~Stupendous!~"I've never been a fan of fantasy(not read Tolkien's books),but Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring"" totally blew me away!This masterpiece is simply amazing!Everything here is excellent:the acting,the sets,the special effects by Richard Taylor etc.The film was shot in New Zealand for example in Matamata(Hobbiton),Kaitoke Regional Park(Rivendell),Glenorchy(Lothlorien)etc.My favourite characters are:Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen),Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood),Galadriel(Cate Blanchett)and Boromir(Sean Bean).The film is full of incredibly beautiful images(the Dark Riders galloping on their horses etc.),some scenes like a fight with a huge Troll in Moria are literally unbelievable.I still can't believe that Peter Jackson,who was responsible for such excellent(and extremely gory-I might add!)horror movies like ""Bad Taste""(1987)and ""Braindead""(1992)created this masterpiece.I only hope he'll return to his splatter origins.10 out of 10-what else?I am waiting impatiently to see the following two parts.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 September 2023~One of the best films ever made.~A mild mannered hobbit named Frodo, back by eight companions has to face all manner of danger, battling many foes in order to save Middle Earth.I'm not sure I can say much that hasn't been said multiple times, it truly is one of the greatest movies ever made, foolishly I have only watched it once since its original release, and tonight I was as captivated, entertained and genuinely spellbound as I was when I first saw it.Action packed, dramatic, emotional and entertaining, this film has it all, there are no lulls, it entertains you from start to finish, an impressive feat for a film that runs over three hours long.The visuals are sensational, from the glorious landscapes, incredibly costumes and makeup, to the dazzling special effects, you truly are transported to a world of pure fantasy.The music is spot on too, who doesn't love to hear Enya.The acting is phenomenal, credit to all involved, Wood, Lee, McKellen, Blanchett, Mortensen and all concerned are terrific, being a huge Sean Bean fan I have to comment on his amazing performance.It's a fabulous movie.10/10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 April 2023~These three LOTR films are a flat-out miracle -- the high-water mark of fantasy cinema~Just back from seeing Fellowship of the Ring at a special screening from one of our local indy cinemas. I have the Extended Editions of all three on DVD, but I'd never seen the EE on the big screen before, and wow was it worth it. It's an immersive experience like little else I've ever had at the movies. The audience I was in was filled (mostly) with people too young to have seen the original release back in 2001, or else parents who would have gone to the original now taking their kids to it. The whole theater was raptly silent through it all, laughed and gasped at the appropriate places, and applauded at the end. I really think the Extended Editions take care of most of the shortcomings or gaps in the original theater-release versions, and by now should be the canonical versions.All three of the LOTR films get a 10/10 from me, but you can make a reasonable argument that Fellowship is the best of them. There's so much material, so much ground to cover, done so well! It has the crucial job of starting off the epic task of building an entire world in front of our eyes, setting the scene, and introducing most of the key characters: and the stakes were high. Had this opener failed, the rest of the trilogy would have been dead in the water and maybe would have brought down New Line Cinema with it. Scene after scene that sticks in the memory: the lengthy Introduction with Cate Blanchett's silky voice narrating. The Shire, of course. The inn at Bree, and Weathertop. The ride to the fords of Bruinen. Rivendell and the Council of Elrond. Moria and the bridge of Khavad-Dum. Lothlorien. The Riven Anduin, the Argonath, Boromir, the splitting of the Fellowship. Peter Jackson and his immense New Zealand crew succeeded in conjuring an entire self-consistent universe for us to live in that, still, no other fantasy movie has ever come close to achieving. And in each of the three movies there are scenes that I can only call transcendent -- so riveting and cinematically brilliant that they leap right into your heart. One of these is the Mirror of Galadriel. In Two Towers, the very opening. In Return of the King, the chain of signal fires. And think of the major role of Howard Shore's musical score; hyper-romantic, heroic, edgy, comforting, delicate by turns; his themes (leitmotifs, really, like Wagner operas) are as dominant as any character. It's kind of impossible to recall any part of the trilogy without that musical score running through your head. For years, one friend of mine listened to the score on an almost weekly basis, and who can fault him?One VERY important thing that struck me right from the first viewing back in 2001 was how much attention was paid to the historical context of Middle-Earth. We're looking at a world that has already had thousands of years of history and conflict. It's an old civilization and the sense of deep history is being put right in front of us -- the old watchtower of Amon Sul (Weathertop), the ancient mines of Moria and the dwarven halls, the immense old statues of the Argonath, crumbling ruins from ages past, everywhere the Fellowship goes. What's being played out in LOTR at the end of the Third Age is really just the end-game to a long, long story stretching back to the First Age, when the ultimate lord of evil Morgoth was defeated by the gods at Thangorodrim. The equally long Second Age finished up with the Last Alliance of Elves and Men on the slopes of Mount Doom in a bigger, more titanic battle than anything the Third Age would see. This richness of invention is incredibly impressive.And then there's the cast. This series made stars out of Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Karl Urban, Sean Astin, and half a dozen others in career-defining roles. The already-big stars like Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen and Hugo Weaving rose further, and two decades later they are indelibly linked with their LOTR roles.I want to go on and on but I'd be repeating what you can find in any number of reviews elsewhere. So to say again, the LOTR film trilogy is a bloody miracle. Inevitable followups have come along (the Hobbit trilogy of course, and the new Rings of Power series) that are actually not bad. Taken on their own merit, they have great production values and decent acting. It's just that they can't match up to one of the high-water marks of all of cinematic history.I'm still waiting for someone (Peter Jackson, are you listening?) to take on the story that was actually Tolkien's favorite, the one closest to his heart. That's the one with Luthien and Beren, Morgoth and the First Age, the one that set off his whole work on the history of Middle-Earth. Gods, demigods, heroes, monsters, romance, pure good and evil and everything in between -- it's got it all just like LOTR. Well, maybe someday.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 January 2022~The 4K UHD Version is Definitely Worth It~"After viewing in the theaters (early 2000s) and the extended DVD versions (late 2000s), I recently purchased the remastered 4K UHD blu rays with Dolby Atmos, and watched the entire series with my kiddos (7 and 9). It was a fabulous experience, with top-notch picture and sound enhancing the canonical greatness of the story (and the film) itself. It took us about five weeks (December through early January) to watch all three films; in fact, if the extended version is included (and all the extra/extended scenes are high quality, they just needed to limit the length of the theatrical version), the trilogy is basically like a multi-season show of the Netflix (or better, Amazon Prime!) era, which can be enjoyed in 20-30 minute viewings.Sienna's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gandalf, Legolas, and Aragorn; scariest characters: witch king, Mouth of Sauron Sebastian's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gimli ""because he always complains;"" scariest characters: Nazgul (""much scarier than the animated ones"") and the Balrog."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 January 2002~Part 1 of The Rings Trilogy is brilliant~Well what can I say? Without sounding like a broken record, this is, quite frankly, a masterpiece.The first of three films about a young Hobbit's quest to return an evil ring, titled 'The Fellowship of the Ring', this picture is brilliant in every sense of the word.The lush New Zealand scenery portrays a bold and beautiful Middle Earth, while the superb casting of the main cast (including Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler) are perfectly picked for their intriguing and detailed characters.I cannot praise this movie enough. Everything about it - the special FX, the score, the scenery, the plot, the cast - is all fantastic, and for the 3 hours the film runs, it manages to grab you and take you on a spellbinding journey into the imaginary world in which they inhabit... something 'Harry Potter' could never do. 11/10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 January 2016~an emotional beginning~WHile I was first introduced to the Middle-earth movies through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this was the second film from the saga that I watched.While watching it on the extended edition expands the story so much that sometimes it feels a little too extended, it's my second favourite LOTR movie. What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end. You'll understand that only by watching the film.I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but Tolkien's universe is one I loved, and this is one of the movies that introduced me to the whole world.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 December 2019~My Annual Christmas-Trilogy, Great 1. Part, loved The Movie as always~Well what can i say.....Since i guess 10 Years i always watch The Lord Of The Rings-Trilogy on Christmas and it always amazes me again !The Fellowship Of The Ring is the quietest of the Three Movies, but thats because its the movie that builds up the whole Story of The 3parter !Great-Great Acting, Characters, Fantastic Settings.......The Movie is From 2001 , but i think this Movie or this movie Trilogie is never going to be old ! The Special Effects never get old, arent too much......a little bit old-school, a little big cgi, everything great and not too much like...:The Hobbit, and unworthy Follow-Trilogy of That Masterpiece of 3 Movies !Greetings From Germany !~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 June 2005~An Excellent Movie Choice!~I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 May 2015~This trilogy is a trilogy that I don't think gets enough credit.~"I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom.I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing.The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored.When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category.Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films.The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot film.These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy.My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs.The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic.Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit.FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~4 February 2022~100/100, perfection personified~No other film trilogy is as strong, not by measure of their individual parts nor as the complete saga, and I doubt that there will ever be any trilogy to take the crown from LOTR.I saw all three multiple times in the cinema upon their release, and countless times at home since, including a few 15 hour marathons of their extended versions which once viewed are forever indispensable by comparison to their theatrical versions. The commentary tracks and behind-the-scenes footage on the extended versions are just brilliant.LOTR has been a core part of my life for over 20 years, as of the writing of this review. I've been obsessed with the films, books, games, music, and everything about it really. Alongside the Halo saga and all that includes such as its music, LOTR is the best, and both started in the same year.I just now hope that the upcoming LOTR tv series doesn't screw it up too badly.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 December 2014~A amazing start to one of the best trilogies ever~I have to say Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job at translating this into film. He got everything down to a tee. The sweeping cinematography captures the enormousness of Middle Earth as well as provides for some beautiful eye candy. The combination of practical and special effects allow for some extraordinarily detailed scenes that really bring Tolkien's world to life. The casting is absolutely perfect. Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas?, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Christopher Lee as Saruman? You simply cannot do better than that, and I applaud whoever did the casting. All these things come together to form a masterpiece of a film that is the start to one of the best trilogies of all time.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 June 2019~Fantastic!!!~I'm a huge fan of medieval fantasy. And J. R. R. Tolkien is the father of the genre. I read the book and lived it. But when the movie aired, it blew my mind. Many scenes were exactly as I had imagined them, and many were way better. Direction is flawless, performances are extraordinary, photography is breath taking with incredible locations and the story is perfectly narrated. And the music is incredible. Enya's song brings tears to my eyes. The only thing you could ask of this movie is more! But wait... there IS more. Two more movies follow AND if you buy the DVD special edition, you get 30 more minutes of film. Well worth it. You get to see the hobbits actually fight and even kill a few orcs. One of the best fantasy movies ever.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 April 2021~Fellowship of the Ring~"What Star Wars was for many people, this was for me. I saw it five times in the theater. I still get chills the moment I hear the orchestra pick up and Galadriel say ""One ring to rule them all. One by one, the free peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring."" I'm getting chills just thinking about it. A perfect film.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~20 March 2002~Outstanding~I am not normally much of a fan of the `Sword & Sorcery' genre, but this movie just blew me away. The visuals, the acting, the storytelling, all are simply superb. There's plenty of CGI and special effects, but unlike certain other movies (Terminator 2, for example) they do not dominate the film, but merely enhance the basic plot. This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly the best of the past year. If this doesn't dominate the Oscars, then Hollywood is in a state of serious denial. Films like this is what movies are supposed to be all about.10+ out of ? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 January 2002~2nd time around still a very good film~I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~13 March 2002~THE best fantasy epic of all time~"I hate Star Wars. Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box.The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best.Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought ""FOTR"" after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short.I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING!The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, ""You'd get the next bite next year."" The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once.And to anyone who wonders why ""FOTR"" is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times.All hail ""The Lord of the Rings""."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~5 March 2002~Brilliant adaptation of the Book- JRR Tolkien would be pleased!~I have loved The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and all the writing of Tolkien since the publication of The Lord of the Rings in the '50, when I was in college. Every one in the dorm was reading it and once I got started I could not stop.Since then, I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to my children many time. Now my oldest son has continued the tradition, reading to his children.When I learned that an attempt was going to be made to use actors and recreate Middle Earth without the use of cartoons, I was both thrilled and nervous. Could Peter Jackson and his talented group of actors, writers and other creative people REALLY bring this superb story to the screen?I am happy to say, they HAVE! Every character looks, sounds and acts exactly as I have pictured them all these years. The ensemble acting is beyond praise. These actors ARE Gandalf, Strider, Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Merry, Pippen, Galadriel and Arwen et al.I urge all to see this wonderful film! I can't WAIT for The Two Towers!!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 March 2002~OUTSTANDING IN EVERY RESPECT!~"I don't care what many might think about this, Lord of the Rings rocked me to the ""Beyond"" and back.Powerful visions of the past, epic battles since films like Braveheart, Gladiator and Brotherhood of the Wolf. It packed plenty of punches than a dozen Mike Tyson's put together.Although I hadn't read the books it didn't dissuade me in any way whatsoever to watch this film.Hats off to actors Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee and of course the lovely Sean Bean and Cate Blanchett.Forget Titanic, this by far is more than just a technical accomplishment or creative input. I really do hope that it sweeps the Academy Awards which it will no doubt do.Birds, beasts, demons this film also very much reminded me of gothic visions of other directors like Dario Argento and the late great Lucio Fulci with there dark brooding imaginations featured in their body of works.. .For example the scene where Gandalf confronts the gigantic demon was without a doubt the single most spectacular scene that really does shake the very grounds of the film's sequence.I know I might sound like a real boot kissing art fag for liking this film a little too much, but on the other hand the visuals are most definately the single biggest advantage besides the acting as well. I know I also that not reading the book I might sound biased too, but then again it's personal opinions that really matter.I just hope that the follow up (Two Towers) also lives up to what Fellowship of the Rings offered us.Instant classic 10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 October 2005~One ring - and three great movies - to rule them all.~"A pop culture phenomenon, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is unlike anything that you've ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I've never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 February 2020~The start to a beautiful trilogy~This isn't a film. It's an epic. If you ask 10 people why they think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is so brilliant, chances are you'll get 10 different answers. This trilogy has something for everyone. Friendship, action, a brilliant score, wonderful effects, an entertaining story, emotion, romance, bromance, betrayal... twice, world-building, and that's just the beginning.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 October 2022~Middle Earth is a Place to Marvel~It's just hard to complain about Fellowship of the Ring. Even the time isn't something I'm mad about, regardless of the fact that I watched the extended cut. There's just so much poise and beauty to this movie, even for one that didn't come from a time of great CGI and VFX that we have now. Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with this movie to the most minute detail. Every acting job is done amazingly, and I love every bit of it. One thing I found really interesting was the way humans are portrayed as these greedy people who are hard to manage, compared to such elegant and fun creatures across the Middle Earth. They really make our human conditions shine. From start to finish, there's so many layers of amazing things, and it just brings a smile to my face while watching. The action is sprinkled throughout in a good manner too. I just love Lord of the Rings.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 August 2003~Magical~I haven't read the books so I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie & having heard it was over three hours long I was a bit sceptical about watching it. But I have to say I was amazed - The acting by all concerned is good to excellent especially from Elliah Wood as Frodo & Ian Mckellen as gandalf, The action was well handled & very exciting, The special effects were great but thankfully they didn't distract from the plot (as in MEN IN BLACK 2) The beautiful New Zealand scenery was a joy to watch, and the 3 hours fly by as long as you are prepared to give it a go as it is quite slow to begin with, With the strong characterization of the first 40 minutes. You may be disapointed to see the film end so suddenly as the story follows through 2 more movies, but you'll be thankful you sat down and watched.A future holiday classica must for all adventure/sci-fi fans10/10 just great from start to finish~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~18 December 2003~The epic of our time...~Once every so often in the long history of film, a movie will be made that breaks all boundaries of excellence. In no small way, it captures the eyes, hearts, and imaginations of millions of people around the world, and becomes one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of it's time.Such movies can never be replicated. There is no way you could remake 'Gone With the Wind' and hope to measure it with it's predecessor. There is no way you can retell the first, great 'Star Wars' trilogy and hope to capture the same magic and amazement created all those years ago. (Despite George Lucas's constant efforts to try and make them better... *coughs*)And in the end, there is certainly no way that anyone, in any period of time henceforth, could take J.R.R. Tolkein's classic 'Lord of the Rings' novels and create movies that would dare to rival Peter Jackson's complete cinematic masterpiece.This, my friends, IS the great cinematic masterpiece of our time. There is no replicating. There is no retelling. To call the film perfect is by no means true, but you would definitely have to *reach* perfection if you even dared to capture the brilliance that Jackson has created in his epic trilogy.The landscapes and sets are, to put it shortly, absolutely breath-taking... especially when added to the emotionally stirring score by Howard Shore. The cast is superlative, with each actor completely embodying the characters so perfectly, you'd swear they were born to play them.'The Fellowship of the Ring', when all is said and done, is arguably the greatest telling of a classic story in movie history. It stirs, it inspires, it saddens, and it overjoys. But most of all, it lingers with you... far longer than you believed it capable of doing.And that, in the end, is what makes it the epic it aspires to be.A masterpiece of its time.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~4 March 2016~Fantastic Fantasy Film~No other way to word it: It's a fantastic fantasy film! This is almost the book brought to life - almost. What we have in the film is the heart and core of the book well written & acted, beautifully filmed. Choreographed to perfection. The sets, filming locations and the costuming are drop dead gorgeous. The screenplay / story is outstanding.I have nothing but good to say about this film - all I can do is brag. I *think* J.R.R. Tolkien himself would be very well pleased with this movie. It may not be perfect - but no movie is exactly perfect and this one comes close to it.Yes I highly recommend this film to fantasy film lovers. I'm sure most everyone has seen this film already - but I am long past due to brag... err hummm... write a review, even if it's just to brag.10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~20 October 2016~The First Instant Classic Movie of the 21st Century...~"In 2008, the American Film Institute came up with the list of the 10 Greatest American Fantasy Movies of All Time. There was no way ""The Wizard of Oz"" wouldn't top this list but guess which newcomer took the second spot that would have belonged to ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Indeed, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is not only the most recent inclusion in any American Film's Institute's List (it is also in the Top 100 Greatest Movies) but it's the highest ranked. It says a lot when a less-than-a-decade old film is literally sandwiched by two classics that are half-centuries older.And 2001 was quite a year for Fantasy; the four highest-grossing movies of the year were the first ""Harry Potter"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Monsters & Inc."" and ""Shrek"". And despite that huge competition, it's the cinematic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien that became an instant classic in the same vein than ""Star Wars"" in 1977. I know ""Harry Potter"" deserves a honorable mention but I don't think the series created something as endearing as ""The Lord of the Rings"" did, a myth, a saga made of characters that are now parts of pop-culture. And if George Lucas has an edge over Jackson because he created his own mythology, Jackson still took up the most difficult challenge ever: recreating J.R.R Tolkien's universe on the screen.The book, the movie, the involvement that made the transition from one format to another possible are all explained in DVD special features, as long as the movie itself, and I watched them with excitement, because nothing is worthier of admiration than an impossible mission being accomplished, starting with the book. Tolkien was a man of classical education, the same generation than Asimov and Pagnol, brilliant literate minds who studied languages, sciences and translated their academic background into art. Tolkien's specialty was language and when he created his world, he didn't just throw names or drew forms; he invented languages, civilizations, that the appeal of Tolkien, his stories felt real, like belonging to humanity's canon.Sure they venture into fairy-tale territories but his creatures are people with specific cultures and lifestyles and even individually, they are not all the same. You have the Elves who are wise, beautiful and immortal, men who are brave but easily corrupted, dwarfs who are practical and rough mine-workers and of course, the friendly Hobbits and their bucolic happiness. The story centers on the most universal myth of all-time, good vs. evil, with one a small object that can destroy the world and yet seems indestructible. Tolkien meant it as an allegory for machinery and its poisoning effect on the world, but the story is told in the classical epic way, featuring the quest of nine heroes, and the journey of a young Hobbit named Frodo.Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, is the film's ""Luke Skywalker"" there's something undoubtedly Obi- Wanesque about the Old Wizard Gandalf, played by Ian McKellen who reveals to Frodo the ring's dark secret, and like Alec Guinness, he was Oscar nominated for his performance, a rarity in Fantasy films. And the performances are integral to the film's success, more than the special effects, more than the production design, the armors and weapons, the Orcs' make-up, the battles' choreographs, if that was enough to make a box-office hit, it takes more to get your three films in IMDb's Top 50, just look at the ""Star Wars"" prequels.Speaking of the performances, Ian McKellen displays a wide range of emotion going from the friendly elderly man, to the warm and reassuring friend with Bilbo Haggings (Ian Holm) but he shows who's the boss when needed to. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great chemistry and you cannot doubt over their friendship and the two other hobbits actors know how to play comic reliefs without going over-the-top. The rest of the cast, from Cate Blanchett to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn all in their characters, with as much sincerity and intensity as if they were trying to grab an Oscar and that proves one thing, they respect the work of Tolkien.The DVD features show them all being interviewed about their experience and you can see in Mortensen, McKellen and the late Christopher Lee (who plays evil Saruman) that they have a sort of fascination and respect for the Master. And rightfully so, it took Tolkien fourteen years to finish the book, and four times more to make a film out of it. Jackson understood why it took so long when he started making the film. He shot it in New Zealand, the perfect place to recreate Middle-Earth, savage enough to look like it belongs to ancient times, then he recreated Hobbitebourg, and the film took form, step by step. And he shot the three films at once, to maintain the feeling of continuity.Jackson's determination, hard-work is as colossal as Tolkien's creation, what he did was objectively impossible, but he embraced the courage of his hobbits, the wisdom of Gandalf, the strength of Aragorn and went on his own journey, making an epic fantasy, a historical war film, and a coming-of-age story, and if Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is promised to centuries of fame, the film adaptation will certainly be responsible for it, because that's what makes a myth last, they're translated into different formats, they adapt to their world. And Tolkien's book was begging for a great cinematic adaptation.And Jackson did it. I know there are purists who think the adaptation doesn't do justice to the richness of the book, but the film is still new, give it time. Think of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it was a book, but who can imagine it now without the version of Fleming in mind. Well, in a few decades, ""The Lord of the Rings"" will be as iconic as irreplaceable, maybe it already is."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~23 June 2002~Richly deserving of its acclaim~"Reading through the various posts, I see that the overriding theme amongst the movie's few detractors was that it was ""overly long"" and ""boring"", even prompting one poster to rename the movie ""Bored of the Rings.""Well, these people clearly haven't read the books and thus are not Tolkien fans. J.R.R. Tokien's books are VERY long and descriptive, and even the hard core fan has to wade through certain elements. However, the books are thrilling, sweeping epics, microcosms of the age-old struggles between good and evil. In this context, Tolkien has created a complete alternate world, populated by humans and similarly-evolved races such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, and mixes courage, determination, love and magic to create ""Middle Earth"".Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring accomplishes what no film maker dared attempt in the 47 years. It encapsulates the first book of the trilogy in jaw-dropping fashion onto film. And that bears repeating: the movie is so amazing, so awe-inspiring, so wondrous that through much of the movie, I felt my jaw literally dropping open. It's THAT good.The cast is nearly perfect: Ian McKellan *is* perfect as Gandalf the Grey. The standoff at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum will go down with the alien's tail slowly encircling Lambert in ""Alien"", the initial emergence of the creature from the black lagoon and other horror/fantasy epic moments as one of the all-time great scenes in cinematic history. Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the remarkable ensemble cast give the performances of their careers. The special effects, despite some that claim otherwise, leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout. And the good news is that since the movie has grossed over $800 million world-wide to date, the second and third installments of the trilogy will benefit with post-production special effects improvements.If you haven't seen this movie, you've missed out, big time, unless you can find it still playing somewhere. The big screen is far and away the best place to view this masterpiece, especially sitting up close. I saw it three times in the theaters and would see it again today if it were playing nearby. And I know where I'll be the day ""The Two Towers"" is released: in my local theater, sitting close, watching yet another epic bit of storytelling unfold.A gigantic 10 out of 10."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 January 2007~One of the best movies ever made .~"The fantasy genre is very under appreciated ,mostly because it is considered a genre aimed to the kids .But there are many good and beautifully made titles . Of course ,there are many bad movies ( think in "" Dungeons & Dragons "" ). Fortunately , the trilogy of ""The Lord of the Rings "" it 's a wonderful movie that could be appreciated even for those who aren't fans of the book . Not only offers lots of entertainment but also a interesting story full of complex characters , adequate music , and a wonderful style that not many movies have . Peter Jackson directed some bizarre movies as ""Bad Taste "" or ""Meet the Feebles "" but this is definitely his life work . This movie deserves all the praise that is receiving .? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~13 December 2020~Rock solid~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is epic filmmaking at its finest. As part of terrific trilogy, it's great. It's also great as a stand alone film. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson and company hit the ball out of the park with this movie. The movie looks great. It's stunningly beautiful at times. The script takes a dense book and makes it understandable. The cast is also terrific with standout work by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a long movie that at times feels like it. But when it's ends, it feels like it just started. I remember when I saw this movie in the theater there was a father with his his teen son sitting in front of us. When the movie ended he turned to his son and asked in frustration ""That how it ends?"" (Obviously he didn't understand it was the first installment of three.) I should have told him that yes, that's how a great movie ends.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~20 July 2014~a fantasy masterpiece~This is a great movie. It has great acting. A great story line. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie. The Hobbit movies are better. But still this is a great movie. See it. It is a most see. Great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it. It is long but it will not feel long. Because it is so fast pas. You will not notes the time going by. It is such a great movie. It is so awesome. See it. It has a lot of action. It is very scary. Peter Jackson is a great director. I hoped after this movie more people in my home country of Canada would appreciate fantasy films more. There only do if it is Tolkien s.t.i.y.l. Most people in this country care more about hockey and bad comedies and reality TV.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 February 2021~Magnificent~Magnificent! A great start to the franchise.'The Lord of the Rings' is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.Very eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 January 2019~The fantasy movie~A lot has been said about The Fellowship of the Ring over the years. It was a cultural phenomenon unlike few others at its release. People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies. It's quite likely that the current superhero craze would not have happened had this movie not shown that people cared about make-belief, care about escapism into a foreign and strange world, filled with magic and wonder.It truly is a wonderful movie. There will doubtlessly be other adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnum opus in the years to come. We can only hope that whoever they end getting to direct, will love the world of Middle-Earth as much as Peter Jackson does.Because that's why these movies are so good, why this movie won us over almost instantly. It's not the huge budget, or the talented actors, or even the majestic landscapes of New Zealand. Although they do help. A lot. But in the end it's the hours put in. All the tiniest details that someone included, not because they absolutely had to, but because they wanted to make it as perfect as possible. Because they care about this world, about this story.The Lord of the Rings has now shaped multiple generations. It has shaped how we think about stories. It's definitely one of my favourite books ever written and this one is definitely one of my favourite movies ever made. Not because it's the perfect adaptation. Or the perfect movie. It's neither. There are things changed, which I wish were not. The storytelling has its hiccups. But those don't matter. Because at its heart this movie is in the right. It cares about what it is, what it represents. About what it's telling us. What kind of a story it is.And it is for that reason that I love this movie so much.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 September 2015~Pure fantasy~J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.Since then this story has influenced pretty much every single author that has come after it. Naturally, a movie adaptation was going to be made at some point, but for the longest time people in the business thought it couldn't be done. You needed to introduce a whole new world, including back stories that could fill whole shelves with books and tomes. The amount of characters alone would make it cumbersome. Without even mentioning the special effects needed. But, finally in the late 90s, movie technology had advanced enough that you could theoretically pull it off. And so Peter Jackson accepted the challenge and in the process created a movie trilogy that affected cinema almost as profoundly as the original book trilogy had affected literature.All three The Lord of the Rings movies are fantastic, but if I had to name my favourite, it'd be this one, no doubt. Not because it's the most direct or has the most flowing narrative. Quite the opposite. The first one contains the most story, has the most detail, jumps around the most. And yet it succeeds in pulling you in. I had read the books numerous times before this movie came out. I knew how much sheer information Jackson had to convey in this first film. I had my doubts. But, the thing is, it's beautiful. From the very first chord of music, from the very first lines of dialogue, from the very first scene of the rings being forged, you're in Middle-Earth. There's just no other way to say it. There's movies capture the essence of Tolkien's original books nigh perfectly.For those that read this and have yet to see this film - yes, all three or four of you - know that this is my second favourite film of all time. It is a fantasy film unlike any other, a tale almost without equal. It is the courage and nobility of men distilled into story form. It is The Lord of the Rings.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 June 2013~The Word 'Epic' Gets Tossed Around a Lot Today, But Here It's Appropriate~Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 December 2001~perfect film entertainment like the, oder adventure films from my yoth~I did not read the book, This is a report on the film. We must find a new superlative to describe the look of this movie, There were many scenes that reminded me of some adventure films I loved as a lad, FOUR FEATHERS,THIEF OF BAGHDAD, the Indiana jones & star wars trilogys. This is a 3 hr film with hardly a second of wasted time. The acting as well as the Music, costumes, makeup etc are all Oscar worthy. my rating is a very high **** (the highest I go)? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 March 2002~Should have easily won best film 2002~"Well what can you say that hasn't been said before 2,900 times. One of the biggest films of all time, and a tragedy that the boffoons at the Academy voted snoozathon A Beautiful Mind as best film. Yes it was OK but really how many times have we seen movies similar to that?Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, had everything one could wish for. Top notch acting, a dramatic storyline, superb cinematography, Stunning landscapes and a classic soundtrack!Some reviewers have stated it is too long. I say it's not long enough and I could have quite happily have sat in the theatre for another hour no problem.I also noticed that many people have voted this film a 1. IMDb should have another top film table, minus the silly ""1"" votes. This film could never, ever be a one in anyones imagination.I, like many here, have read and loved the books. Watching the movie we see the images that were conjured up in our minds when reading the books. So many have said its exactly what they imagined it's almost uncanny but fantastic to behold. I totally agree.As for a lot of the doubters saying its not a patch on The Godfather, Shawshank, etc, well they wouldn't know whan a real classic came along to join these great movies. Yes, Godfather is a good movie, Shawshank is a good movie (though in my opinion slightly overated) But LOTR is the fantasy classic of our time. 20 years from now LOTR will have earned itself the status of classic fantasy adventure, with virtually no doubter whatsoever, a landmark that other films will strive, and mostly fail to achieve.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing Middle-earth to life for so many of us grateful fans. Personally I can't wait for the extended DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of unseen footage, which arrives in November.cheers"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~8 June 2022~Is This The Weakest One Or Is It The Best~I think it's impossible and actually pointless to try and view The Fellowship of the Ring or any of The Lord of the Rings films as individual movies: they're a collective achievement. And what you can say about one mostly applies to all.How these films did so much so well from the almost perfect casting to visual and special effects and most aspects from the broadest down to the more minor details were done correctly with only a few exceptions. Naturally, most of this is thanks to Peter Jackson who outside of the trilogy might not be that good of a director but his job here is excellent.The Lord of the Rings thrill and they think, they exceed as entertainment and cinema and will probably continue to hold their well-earned status for years to come.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 November 2016~The Lord of the Rings: The Forging of a Superior Series.~The Fellowship of the Ring is the starting point for the now classic Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and while aspects of the movies haven't aged too well (like the rubbery CGI rag-doll stunt effects), they're still joys to watch and you are truly in Middle-earth. Peter Jackson brings his bombastic and theatrical sensibilities with these movies and his direction brings something from across the emotional spectrum of many different cinematic genres; and the experience works so well.For any lover of Tolkien, such as myself, it's notable and incredibly obvious when Jackson takes creative liberties; but the changes from the novels are necessary. In spite of some of the inevitable changes when making the movies, they play out fine in the end: the changes add nice drama to the story and there's still nice visual subtlety in the performances from the magnificent cast of Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies.The film is full of classic moments like the Mines of Moria sequence, the Lothlórien scenes and of course the good-old Shire: the locations of the Baggins of Bag End. There are so many remarkable things in this movie. Everything right down to the music is well done here and adds to one of the most well-realized fantasy film settings in history.I'd want to thank Peter Jackson personally for giving us the three movies of his fantastical magnum opus based on one of the greatest novels of our time.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 May 2002~The best film of 2001~Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin.I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized. Which leads to one question. What kind of money would one get having to be the film clerk for this trilogy?~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 November 2002~I was bored and read the Cliff Notes in Jr. High; how wrong I was!~"How I wish I could have seen THIS film first. I had no interest whatsoever in The Lord of the Rings books. Let's be honest, when its required reading in literature class and the teacher made middle earth seem as dry as a chip, who would have an interest?Well, this film made me have an interest and want to go back and read the books again. This production was lavishly and handsomely done. I was excited, thrilled, scared at points, cheering, laughing and just caught up in the wonder of this production. There isn't ONE character I didn't like, there wasn't ONE moment I wasn't interested. There is so much I can explain about the film, but for my review, I just want to comment on how it effected me as an ex-student assigned to read a book I though was horrid, and seeing it decades later as a wonderful adaptation that I watched over 100 times by now.Here's another film I did NOT go to the movie house to see and yes, I am kicking my own butt for not doing so. I missed a great film on wide screen, and just to let everyone know, I am in line for ""The Two Towers"" already.Granted, this will not help my ""C"" grade I got when I was assigned to read it back in the day, but I love his film to death. I just bought the expanded DVD, and now I am a Lord of the Rings fan for life!Future LOTR literature teachers, take note! Then make sure your students get to see the film as a companion piece to the books...believe you me, they'll thank you later with plenty of interest."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 September 2016~Peter Jackson hit full in the adaptation of Tolkien 's tales.~when Peter Jackson decided to adapt the tales of Tolkien master, the greatest work of history of fantasy, The Lord of The Rings, I believe that many were with a behind foot, who would say that this work could be adapted more Peter Jackson adapts brilliantly Peter hit full in the choice of casting, Elijah Wood is his best role in his career, Sean Astin this great, Ian McKellen dispenses comments, impeccable as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, Baker Hall, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, and etc., the cast is spectacular, and the acting is much of great, the special effects are incredible, even more epoch that was released, the picture is beautiful, the film adapts well to land-media, the costumes are incredible, the opening scene of the film is one of the best of film history, which explains everything we know about the rings, the battle scenes are impeccable, the characters are great, my favorites are Smaug (which appears little longer appears in the next film), Gandalf, Aragorn, Sean and Legolas., the film is over, spend more flying, the pace is very good, and the script even with some problems, is very good, the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of a trilogy that had been in the film history.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 December 2018~I wish I had an 11th star to give~I read the book for the first time when I was 10 so I had been waiting for this movie for a very, very long time. With apprehension. But I am glad they waited so long to make it, as the result is an absolute masterpiece that will satisfy even the most hardcore Tolkien fans.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~30 December 2001~Book me on the next journey to Middle Earth.~"Many people have expressed their fondness for this first part of the trilogy already, so I'll devote this brief review to discussing the flaws of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""Flaw 1: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. In amongst an otherwise fine cast, she's the only one of the principals who seems to not believe where she is; her performance suggests she thinks she's in a perfume commercial (you almost expect her to say ""Obsession. Calvin Klein""), and the soft-focus of her scenes only underlines that impression.Flaw 2: IT ENDS!Sam supplies the best possible review: ""Well, that was an eye-opener."" New Line has a great Christmas 2002 present lined up for us...? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~17 April 2002~Peter Jackson, I salute you....~First things first - I've read LOTR probably 3/4 times. & the Silmarillion and bits of the Unfinished Tales and yadda yadda yadda....I however have grown up enough to know that LOTR (the book) is for many a great novel because it relates to when they first read it...it is great within it's context but not the greatest book ever or any of that tosh...IMHO all lists are bunkum anyway.So having got that off my chest, here is another confession....I was worried, very, very worried about LOTR on the big screen. Would it be a 'Krull', a 'Willow', a 'Beastmaster', a.........urgh,,,Dungeons & Dragons? You know what I mean...fantasy is damn hard to do. The Tolkien imitators that plague the bookshelves prove this as do the whole stackfull of cheesy, hammy fantasy movies with cheesy, hammy names chasing after magical McWidgets to save the nation / planet / galaxy / universe from eternal damnation. I had prepared a crushing hex for Peter Jackson if he inflicted this fate upon LOTR.But there was a sign of hope, like Glamdring's pale fire in the smoke and flames of the Balrog (er, enough of that) - 3 films. Not 1 mish-mashed jampacked farce-fest. No, 3 full-length films giving the book's epic scale a chance to work it's wonder on the filmgoers.Well Peter Jackson pulled it off - by resolutely avoiding the 'big-name' actors, by insisting on New Zealand for filming, by used WETA for effects, by nipping & tucking the story where required (I suspect even Jackson could not have kept Tom Bombadil from looking like total clown), by expanding where needed (another writer is very correct that Arwen's importance is only clear in the book during the Appendix).If you don't like fantasy one little bit...which makes me wonder where exactly your imagination resides....then even with this appalling handicap LOTR 'Fellowship of the Ring' can still enthrall you. If you love the book, the film still does the trick. If you just like being contrary for the sake of it then I guess you won't like this film. But then I doubt you like much else in life either.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~5 June 2004~Amazing. A Masterpiece.~I was so happy when I saw this. It is proof that Hollywood can spend huge budgets and not always produce bad movies! They need to hire a director who's not from Hollywood, but they can still do it!This is a great adaptation of the first book of the LOTR trilogy with not too much deviation. The cinematography and sets are particularly amazing. They truly capture Tolkien's rich language and vivid detail from the book. All the lush visuals are beautifully rendered in what is one of the few good uses of extensive CGI.The non-CGI elements like the costumes and music are also breathtaking. The people who worked on this worked their butts off many times and they deserve all the praise they have gotten and will surely receive for the rest of their careers in film. 10/? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~6 July 2002~Oh... the brilliance that is Peter~The more and more one thinks of it, the more one reads Tolkien and appreciates it, the more and more brilliant this movie becomes. Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work... I love this film! Tis Brilliance!A word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy. Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron. Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though. The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two. As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10/10~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 July 2022~Epic movie~The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films that comes once in a lifetime, how fortunate we are as human beings to be around at a time where 3 of these films are released within 3 short years!!The fellowship is just the perfect blend of setting the story, fleshing out characters and introducing us to the world of middle earth!Ian McKellen as Gandalf is just legendary.... mysterious, loveable, occasionally hilarious and in THAT iconic scene, completely immortalised.Elijah wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd showcase perfectly not only their playful naivety and innocence but a good heart along with their fierce will and courage to do whatever it takes.Sean Bean does what he does best in most films but has never upset as more in this case and whilst doing so shows us both the best and worst qualities of humans in the harsh, hostile but magical world of Middle earth.By the end of the film you're dying to see what happens next and at every turn you get both attention to detail and storytelling that is seldom found elsewhere.If you haven't watched the Fellowship of the Ring yet, I beg of you! Do it!! It's the first film of a trilogy that is so close to perfection that it will only be seen once in a lifetime 🏅~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 November 2002~One movie to rule them all...~"...that was maybe too much! But, I do got to say: one of the best movies ever made!Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo Baggins, the confused, scared but brave little fellow. Then we got this Strider guy, Aragorn. Viggo Mortensen plays him supreme and is probably the movies best character, and we've got Sean Bean as Boromir, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Liv Tylor as Arwen, Ian MacKellen as Gandalv and we can go on and on.The film music is one of the best I've ever heard! Especially after Gandalv has died - very mood."" Run you fools! "" One ring to rule them all, but Tolkien, you could have dropped all those names: Urun, Mordor, Sauron, Arathorn and I could have said hundreds more! They're simply nothing to me, I don't care who Gimli is the son too! I don't care what flame that comes from Urun! But - enough of that."" Get off the road! "" Nazgul, there we've got the movies little creepy part. Riding horses, wearing these black clothes and armed with long swords. A movie that really touches you. Great! Fantastic! Simply...brilliant. Role dice: 6- ( a little too much ass )"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 June 2003~An instant classic.~Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~30 July 2005~Brilliant and peerless~"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD (Extended Version) and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two distinct categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"".Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve.Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 February 2002~Perfect film-making, flawless fantasy rollercoaster ride!~"I am one of few who openly admits his favourite movies are Edward Scissorhands and Titanic, but before seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (abbr. FOTR) I knew I was going to see something unique.But nothing prepared me for this: jawdropping sets and special effects, details that are almost on the verge of sanity (!) and brilliant costumes and make-up. To have such a blend with amazing cast and director... is a delight. Peter Jackson has performed a miracle. He's taken the most popular novel of 20th century, defied the pessimists, stood tall in his shorts and turned it into the greatest movie I've ever seen. I tell you, everything in the film was ""perfect"". Nothing less.The script must have been difficult to write but it has been done so well here. Peter Jackson has also managed to get a cast that is known but not really ""super-star"", and they are perfectly cast in their roles. Fate brought Viggo Mortensen into the role of Aragorn (I can't see how Stuart Townsend was chosen) and I've never seen an actor live into the character so much. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, so no contest and hand him the Oscar, thank you. The hobbits are wonderful and especially well portrayed, led by Elijah Wood, the story's small hero. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are heavenly and Tyler even surprised me with good accent and acting. So did Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee and that newcomer Orlando Bloom.Added to this is the mythic and wonderful music from Howard Shore. I love it and it brings me everytime to the emotional highs and lows of the film and I see the sorrow, the faces and my heart cries out. It's a powerful film, with marvellous acting and music and sets..., directed flawlessly by soon-to-become-my-favourite-director Peter Jackson. At the end I can only say that I thank each and everyone involved with this movie because I felt better as a person after seeing it, and I'm always thankful for a perfect time. FOTR is indeed perfect!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~8 March 2002~Jon Monsarrat review: Perfect. A Fantasy movie that non-fantasy people will like.~"Like many fans of the book, I walked into LOTR mentally praying ""please, if there is a God, don't let them screw this up.""They didn't. The movie is flawless; perfect, and pays tribute worthy of the original book. Acting, visuals, directions, perfect.If you normally don't care much for fantasy, but might be persuaded to see one, just one movie with ""elves"" and such, this is the one.One note, however -- check your watch when the movie starts so you will know when the ending is coming up. That way you won't get caught out in a couple of places where it ""feels"" like the movie might end at any moment. It is long, so be ready for that.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~5 December 2001~An amazing adaptation!~I have never seen a novel more faithfully and beautifully brought to the screen. Everything was just as I'd imagined while reading the novel. There are a few sections of the book that were left out of the film and there is information in this first movie that isn't revealed until later in the trilogy of novels. However, the movie is so well done, all is forgiven. Gorgeous cinematography, spot-on casting, lush score, and the right mix of sentiment, suspense, and comic relief. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while. Brilliantly done!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 October 2005~Great Fantasy Book Becomes One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made~When Peter Jackson took on this amazing trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien he was taking one of the biggest dares in cinematic history. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has gathered countless fans over the world. The books are captivating masterpieces that delve deep into our imaginations. To think that it would be transferred to the big screen. But Peter Jackson had that certain touch, he turned a great book into a film that will be treasured as one of the greatest films to ever have been made.For those who haven't read the books (I urge you to) the plot focuses on a ring. A ring made for evil. This ring can turn the bearer invisible at will. By luck, this ring lands into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from The Shire. He passes it down to his nephew Frodo Baggins. When Gandalf finds out about this he immediately sends Frodo on a quest to destroy The One Ring. Because if it falls into the wrong hands it could mean an end the Middle Earth. Along with Samwise Gamgee they set off on an epic adventure.This movie is one-of-a-kind. An adaption has never been this good. Everything about this movie is captivating and just so brilliant. I have read the Fellowship just once but I was just so pleased with this movie. The way Peter Jackson has gone from paper-to-film is very inspiring. The look of Middle Earth is extremely beautiful. The beautiful Hobbiton and dread-filled Mordor are just perfect.The roles are perfectly suited. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise was a perfect choice and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was an extremely smart choice. This movie is just perfect and if you haven't seen it I urge now. GO SEE IT!! 5/5.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 August 2003~Wow~This film is a triumph in almost every aspect. I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time. And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works. The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts. From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you. And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages. It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments. Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like. There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience. A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking. If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~20 October 2014~This movie is the best~This is one of the few movies I've seen that does justice to the book it represents. True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours. This movie is incredible. There simply is nothing to complain about. The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime. The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable. This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least). I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters. This movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scenes are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the innocent hobbit on a journey. There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~18 January 2021~First, And Still The Best Of LOTR~"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~10 February 2003~An electrifying eye candy feast.~"A wonder to behold and not to be taken for granted, the first chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers.The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as ""the Fellowship"".Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the ""Fellowship"". There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here.Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past.One last thing, since I haven't seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved ""Best Picture"" and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~31 March 2020~A transporting film with the definitive metaphor for human strength and weakness~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001) is such a definitive adventure, perfectly realised through the intention of Peter Jackson.The truly awe-inspiring production design, the perfect casting of everyone from Elijah Wood to Ian McKellen, the haunting score by Howard Shore, the perfect editing (in both versions, in my opinion). It is simply a work of art, and perfectly realised.But what to me is the most beautiful message of Tolkien's masterpiece delivered for the screen by Jackson is the symbolism in the world of Middle Earth. The ring is perhaps the purest ever depiction of the fragility of the human condition. Our search for power, influence and the ego. At the same time, the way in which love is portrayed by Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and perhaps most of all Sam, is daringly beautiful - in fact all Tolkien's caricatures of Christ.A definitive statement - not only for the fantasy genre - but one which has cemented itself in cinema history."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~13 June 2023~Great Movie~"Rating: 9.3 Overall, a great introduction into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as the execution and different parts are well done to start this epic story off as the audience is left wanting more from the characters and the story as they transition into the next part.Great to Incredible Direction (Really moves the story forward and gets the best out of his actors as it drives the audience to be enticed with what happens next throughout the story), Great Acting (No one performance stands out as everyone acts as a unit to progress the story forward), Great to Incredible Story (really captivating on seeing how the journey progresses as we see the Fellowship go on this quest to Mordor, also the different elements of the story are very important as they comeback to play a role in the film), Great Screenplay (While the very ""Middle English""-esque text is hard to follow sometimes, the actual dialogue is very well written as we see the director use it well to help tell the story (especially in the narration parts); also, the symbolism throughout the movie (specifically, about a boy who is trying to grow up and be a hero trope)), Great Score (with memorable themes), Pretty Good Cinematography (While for the most part it was very good at capturing the scenes, I found the slow-shaky shots incredibly annoying), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (While there were some hiccups, the CGI was incredible for its time), Great Production Design, Great Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was well laid out as it is about a 1/3 of a full-length story (and treats it as such with all the elements of a solo movie, yet still taking into account there is more to go), Pacing was very fast (especially for a movie that is 3 hours long) as it felt like they were trying to fit so much in (which does make sense given how dense the books are), Build to climax was good as we get to see them embark on one arc of their journey to Mordor; climax was well executed as we get to see the sacrifices the characters have to make to go on their quest, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it treated as such), Given this movie is the first of three parts Peter Jackson does a great job in setting the story and the conflict that the other movies will take off from as we see the internal struggles present in all the characters and the importance of what is needed to be done from the quest (so it is acceptable to treat the movie as an overall exposition even though it has elements of a solo movie)"~9

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 May 2002~Very good~I absolutely love this movie! This movie has really awesome action and very great special effects. The acting was way too good. Ian McKellan should have won for best supporting actor, not that Tom Wilkinson was bad but I really enjoyed his performance. I haven't yet read the book but I hear it's as good as the movie.Overall I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. This is probably the only long movie that I can see again and again. rating 10 out of 10.? ~10

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 December 2020~The arrival of people means 'to blossom'~For years, I've possessed the superiority of The Fellowship of the Ring over its two successors; it's only now - perhaps, if I hadn't previously forgotten - that I think I'm able to officially understand why the superiority . .For Fellowship, the motif is that arrival of people means 'to blossom'; since Fellowship in and of itself is arrival, the motif as possession is more the merrier? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~9 February 2022~Stunningly Excellent!~I was born in 1999. This trilogy came out in 2001, 2002, & 2003.I had older brothers who saw these in theaters (jealous)! They got them on vhs tape and watched them every weekend while babysitting me while our parents worked.By the time I was 5 (2004), I had seen this trilogy many times. After we'd watch them, we played the PS2 video games. Fun memories.As time went on, my brothers got into trouble. Ironic how the films they introduced me to helped me through the tough times that they caused.I am grateful to them for only that. Without LOTR, I don't know where I'd be. The strength of these beautiful characters has helped me persevere. Tolkien was a genius! I've read almost the whole trilogy. And played the games countless times.Peter Jackson is as genius as Tolkien. You can tell he really took his time to honor this man's unique universe. The excellent casting, costuming, wigs, props, EVERYTHING!The fact that the actors had to learn to speak properly, and speak Elvish. And how to do combat.From what I remember, there are hardly any differences between book and film. And those that are, are understandable.Jackson did Tolkien justice. If anyone tries to recreate this trilogy, I WILL riot.I'm going to devote a whole paragraph to the music. Howard Shore was a gamble considering he'd never done anything like this before. But did Jackson win big with that gamble!The music is one of THE most memorable film scores out there! You hear it and you know it. That's the sign of a talented musician. Even my mom knows the music and can even respect the material. And she doesn't like fantasy.I adore all the detail put into these cinematic masterpieces that still don't look dated. The voice acting, cgi and green screen blend so well into what's real, you find yourself in the real world looking around in disbelief that an Ent isn't outside your door!Thank you Peter Jackson! Thank you crew! Thank you cast! Thank you Howard Shore! And especially thank you to J. R. R. Tolkien. May your memory and universe live on forever!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~27 December 2005~Perfection (well, almost)~What can I say that is able to describe the immense quality of this film? Words don't come easy when I try to describe the impressive beauties of an epic legend turned into images. The enormous task of adapting the film is superb, with and outstanding plot, a perfect direction and a very well chosen casting of actors! Is is a film that fills and overwhelms all I had imagined when I read the book. There is few films than for me, deserve a 10, if I could, for this one, I would give a 12 to it!!! Emotion, action, love, passion, tragedy, greed... All the most touching emotions of our world moved into an fantastic and moving world filled with strange creatures that will, of course, make you stay 4 hours (yeah, 4!, so big is the greatness of the film!) in your sofa, absolutely amazed and desiring to know how continues. Peter Jackson (the director), must have been inspired by God to do such a perfect film!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 November 2006~A brilliant epic - Peter Jackson brings Middle-Earth to life.~I have watched this film 80 times (no lie) - I have enjoyed it every time. Peter Jackson has brought Middle-Earth to the screen brilliantly and with glory - New Zealand's beautiful scenery and huge mountains recapture Tolkien's world in a way that would make him proud. On top of that, every actor owns his/her role 100% (especially Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf) and delivers very powerful, meaningful performances that ensure that every character has their own story to tell (and their own movie to act). Though some of the battle scenes aren't great - there is obvious ragdoll usage in the troll fight scene - this film is a stunning start to the most successful trilogy of the millennium and a chance to experience Tolkien's world on screen for yourself as it always should have been - flawless. A must-see. 10/? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 January 2016~Peter Jackson Conjures Up the Most Potent Motion Picture Magic in Years!~The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai.In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom.Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment.Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way.Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~26 June 2002~You want more after 3 hours~"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring would make the late author very proud. It is extremely well done with a great cast of actors. There are not enough female roles in this story and it is a great story. Who would have thought that Sean Astin grew up to be a hobbit from his days as a ""goonie"" and Tobey Maguire who was best known for his role in the Ice Storm as Mike. Now he is the star of the film. He plays beside the wonderful attractive Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, the magnificent Christopher Lee as the dastardly wizard gone arye, Sir Ian McKellen as the wonderful charming gandalf(Sure he could play Macbeth and Shakespearan role but he certainly can play his friend, Dame Maggie Smith, in a Saturday Night Live appearance. He was just perfect and now he plays with his action figures. Then there is wonderful Sir Ian Holm (Just imagine two Sir Ians on the set, what are the chances). The film is about 3 hours and after all that there is still more and you want more. I only wished that they would finally give knighthood to Christopher Lee and John Rhys-Davies.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~27 November 2007~Difficult to Fault!!~"How can a film miss when it has everything going for it, storyline, graphics, authenticated digitalization, and maybe some of the most fabulous cinematography that I have ever seen in any movie made whatsoever!! This was a painstaking effort of folklore and fantasy which homogenized in conjunction with the rendition of the novel ""Lord of the Rings"" by Tolken!!! I do not know if anybody remembers the animated version of ""Lord of the Rings"" made in 1978? I enjoyed it very much!! However, with this triumvirate of epic ""Lord of the Rings"" movies which besieged the movie viewer in the early part of this decade, and eventually took the movie industry by storm, more and more film aficionados will appreciate Tolken's work now than ever before!! ""Fellowship of the Ring"" fascinates the movie audience by manufacturing monsters who wind up taking on mere mortals... This induces a David and Goliath confrontation which provides a suspenseful entertainment for anyone watching this film!! I just cannot get over the breathtaking cinematography in this film!! I believe it was filmed in New Zealand, now, I want to go there!!! Rated as one of the top twenty American movies ever made, I definitely recommend seeing ""Lord of the Rings/ Fellowship of the Ring"" Survival of the fittest never became more creative than with this movie!!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~3 January 2015~Absolutely Magical~This film (along with the entire trilogy) is regarded as one of the greatest, most influential films of all time and with good reason. This movie has audiences captivated from the beginning to the end. Even watching it in 2015, I am still stunned by the special effects, the set, the scenery, the acting, the plot, the camera shots and angles, the make up, the costumes, and the editing among many other factors. Most note-worthy is the score which brings a whole new perspective and sound to science fiction and to fictitious worlds and characters. Even though the story contains a lot of sci-fi jargon, the writing and dialog do a very good job in relaying the information to the audience. The writers did an excellent job in simplifying and clarifying an intricate and brilliant story.Well done Peter Jackson. You deserve the fame and fortune you received from this movie.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~13 December 2005~Bring the Magic Back to Movies~"Seeing ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" made me feel like a kid again, bringing me back to 1958 watching ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" with Ray Harryhausen's heroic special effects.""LOTR"" claims its rightful place as one of the founts of inspiration for ""Star Wars,"" with its conflicted good guys up against a growing stronger evil -- that resonates in a post-9/11 world as it must have for Tolkien post-WWI and concurrent with WWII (and eerily like HBO's ""Band of Brothers"").The cast of Brits, Americans and Antipodeans (including obscure favorites of mine from Brit TV and indie movies) team up amidst special effects that are thrilling yet comprehensibly old-fashioned.In terms of comparing it to the book, I'm one of possibly two or three Baby Boomers who didn't read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" until this month (and will wait to complete the rest of the cycle in time for the following two movies), so I was both fresher to the material and less fanatical about it than some, including clarifications of some bits that I had misunderstood in the book.I appreciated some of the telescoping of details (such as combining the elf princess Arwen, as played by Liv Tyler, with a legendary princess' love story) and missed others (by leaving out Tom Borondil and his mate the River's Daughter, the brightness of nature is left out, making for a darker movie than even the book). The endless exposition in the book is handled well, as both voice overs and through flash-back demonstrations. The final DVD will include deleted scenes.Particularly well-handled is graphically showing the tempting danger of the Ring's evil power, on others and on Frodo -- a key difference in the mature themes of ""LOTR"" in comparison to ""The Hobbit.""I was disappointed that the songs and mythic poetry were barely replaced by Enya's hardly noticeable background music.(originally written 12/29/2001)"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 November 2002~One of the greatest films of all time.~"Star Wars has been dethroned. Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'. Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal.Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously. With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen. This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for. Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back. There are no slow spots, just one climax after another. From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away. The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done.The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything. The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey. The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness. The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical. The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project. The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting.I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director. I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom. Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~9 December 2001~Not only epic, exquisite film-making, but HISTORICAL- this one'll go down in the books (no pun intended)~"Holy *$#t. Mind-blowing is a word that comes to mind. Think the intensity of Requiem for a Dream meets the epic story of Braveheart meets the eye-popping cinematography and visuals of the Terminator movies and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Then sprinkle in a few acting lessons that bring to mind the ablilites of Brando and Olivier and a novel-to-film adaptation that rivals Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and you'll have, maybe, a FRACTION of an idea of what this movie accomplishes- and, having only read the Hobbit, it still manages to astound and mind-boggle myself, who am not a ""hardcore"" LOTR fan. Best-Picture material.? "~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 June 2002~an amazing movie, great story and beauty~"the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring is probably the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. Every scene is breathtaking, it is truly an amazing job jackson did. If you have ever read the lord of the rings or the hobbit, you know what i mean when i say its almost exactly what you would imagine middle earth to look like.Sure, they changed some things from the book, but i think they did a better job than most movies taken from novels. I wouldn't say that this was as good of a ""film"" as the usual suspects, fight club, or the shawshank redemption, but it was probably the best ""movie"" i have ever had the pleasure of viewing.?

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 January 2002~Quite Simply: One of the Best Films Ever~A few thousand reviews in a month or so bespeaks of many things. I find it hard to add what has already been said. But I will try to capsulize my take on LORD OF THE RINGS:1. Superlatives are insufficient to describe the utter awe that this movie has elicited - in me - and in the world.2. You'll never be able to please everyone. Mr. Jackson has virtually achieved that. I haven't seen such a splendiferous response to a movie in a long time - not even from 'Titanic' or 'Harry Potter'.3. The movie's opening comes at the most propitious time in history. We need fantasy right now, Harry Potter and other vehicles are providing that...but it is hard to compare them to the sheer virtuosity of this movie's execution.4. 3 hours has always been a horror story to Hollywood's mass market audiences. But to anyone who has attended a screening of a really long movie like Bertolucci's '1900' 5 hrs+ or 'The Sorrow and The Pity' (almost 5 hours - depending on the version), 3 hours is NOTHING. Movies SEEM to be getting longer these days. But the audiences are not complaining as much as they once did. This is a good thing.Frankly, at the end of the movie...I just wanted to go ON AND ON.5. Every actor, every scene, every effect is believable. Despite the more than generous mix of sets, real outdoor scenes, created outdoor scenes and mixtures of these, one's beliefs are never jarred from the Tolkein-Jackson fantasy world.6. The Howard Shore music (which suggests some measure of doom by adapting the most famous motto in history - second only to Beethoven's Fate Motto from his Symphony #5 in Cminor - the DIES IRAE (Day of Wrath) theme from 'Office of the Dead' from the extensive catalog of Gregorian chants) - uses music and sound and not just Super-compressed FOLEY sounds (which are OVERUSED these days to a fault instead of music in order to shock audiences into an artificial level of frenzy)...to evoke true suspense and excitement.7. Elijah Wood - proves that no other actor could have portrayed Frodo (even if the 'book Frodo' was much older). His performance is astonishing in the breadth he exudes with the economy he expends. His eyes are among the most expressive I've seen in a long time.Elijah has always taken the more interesting and unflashy parts during his surprising career. But in each role I have seen, he has brought deep human emotion and a strength found ever so rarely in the more flashy actors. This is not to deride as Speilberg's choice of Haley Joel Osment as Frodo. Quite simply, Haley would have been just too young and though his talents seem limitless to us now, Elijah just IS FRODO.Thanks to all involved in the making of this masterpiece. The world cannot wait for the next two!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~10 August 2002~"Very high production values, very long, perfect for ""Ring"" fans."~"I went to school in the 1950s and 1960s. I never read ""The Hobbit"" nor any of the ""Ring"" trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about, although I already knew there were ""Ring"" fanatics of all ages out there. I got a ""free"" DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be ""Ringheads."" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of ""extras"", several ""making of"" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year.While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that ""the fellowship of the ring"" will undertake, to ultimately return the ""one ring"" to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a ""great"" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~20 June 2002~A Beautiful Triumph for Peter Jackson~The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie.About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world.6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world.I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~16 June 2022~A thrilling Introduction to kick off mybfavourite movie trilogy~"""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" is directed by Peter Jackson.It stars Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee.The first part in this great trilogy follows a hobbit named ""Frodo"" and companions who are tasked with destroying the one ring which could bring chaos and destruction to ""Middle Earth"".""The Lord of the rings"" trilogy is for me the greatest trilogy ever made. I could watch these films any day.The positivesThe films premise and story is fantastic. The film is near enough three hours of setup but it also does a great job in captivating you to watch the next films. Every character has distinct personalities along with great motivations and starter development. The romances and friendships all feel real thanks to all the actors having great chemistry along with great performances. ""Ian McKellen"" is for me perfect casting. No one else can play ""Gandalf"" In my eyes. The action in this film is fantastic. Not only are the stakes high in them but they are shot brilliantly. The whole film is shot fantastically. There's so many unique shots in the film that are memorable. The character design and makeup are all flawless. The ""Orc"" makeup is so good that I sometimes forget the people playing them are actors as they look so real. The CGI is fantastic even to today's standards. Finally the film also manages to be really scary. The film is full of creatures that won't hesitate to kill. When the characters are in danger I still get chills because of how scary those scenes are.The negativesThe only minor flaw is that a couple of action scenes just last a bit too long especially the staircase scene. But all the action is entertaining and full of tension.ConclusionFor me, ""Fellowship of the ring"" is one of the best first acts to a trilogy ever made. With its interesting story and characters, incredible chemistry and acting from the actors, brilliant camerawork, thrilling action, state of the art CGI, great makeup and some genuine scary scenes make this film almost perfect.I'm going to give ""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" a:10/10."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~18 April 2002~The Greatest Motion Picture Of Cinema History~I love this film. I simply love it. This is Tolkiens novel, and the world of Middle-Earth, the characters of Middle-Earth and the events of Middle-Earth! I love this film.This is the kind of film that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation. It is THAT good.There are three wizards: Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Peter Jackson, the director. The breathtaking detail Jackson has put into this is incredible. Lets start with the acting.This is a star studded cast, with Elijah Wood in the main role as Frodo, McKellen as mentioned, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler . .. the list goes on and on and on. Each has put 101% into this masterpiece, and it really shows.The sets are incredible. One can believe they are in Khazad-Dum, or in Bree, or in Hobbiton, or Rivendell particuarly. It will take your breath away, some of the incredible locations. We know each is not real, but there is a hint of realism in there.This is a special effects bananza, used only when needed. In Khazad-Dum and Isengard particuarly you can almost feel the power given off by the magic in this film.The costumes are perfect. The score (designed by Howard Shore) is breathtakingly beautiful. And throughout this, Jackson maintains a sense of calm and reality in the film, and it is this inner flare and outer cool that makes him and the entire cast and crew the magicians that they are. Probably the greatest motion picture of cinema history. 10+ out of 10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~9 July 2002~Breathtaking!~"Reading the other reviews here, it seems that people either loved this movie or they hated it. It also seems that those who say they hated it don't give any concrete reasons other than they don't seem to ""get the point."" The same is true of the books that this series is based on: some people think them to be the best works of fiction of all time, while others think they are nonsense. Well, you can count me firmly in the ""loved it"" camp!Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies. (My other hope is that someone would take on the project of making quality film versions of Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy,"" but that's a different story!) The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking! Never mind the minor differences between the film and the books, this has got to be the best adaptation of book to cinema that I have ever seen. I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen.Why? If you are one of those who ""don't get it,"" I can't offer anything to convince you. Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series. The action is gripping. The visual effects are stunning. There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair. The acting is flawless. And through the entire experience, there is the constant theme of pure good versus pure evil; and staying true to one's friends and commitments regardless of how bad things get. And it does it without being preachy about it: it is totally free of the absurd political correctness that infects so many other films.This movie hits on all cylinders. The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed. Nobody got up during its three hour length. There was no whispering or other signs of inattention. When it was over and the lights came on, there was a continued hush that was almost reverent. When people started to get up, I heard comments like ""It's going to be a long year."" (Meaning, of course, it will be a long wait until the second installment is released this December.)The only flaw I can find is that it was too fast-paced in some places, resulting in some parts of the story being a blur for those who aren't already familiar with the books. Even so, the three hours go by very quickly and leave you wanting to see more of the story. That will have to wait until the end of this year!For those who haven't yet seen it, I would strongly recommend reading the books (or at least read The Fellowship of the Ring) and then rent or buy the dvd when it is released this August."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~31 March 2020~Good~I like the bit where they walk and walk and walk and walk.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~7 August 2002~AMAZING!~Truly one of the best films ever made! It was robbed of the best picture Academy award. This movie does not disappoint. Even those who are not fans of the books, love this movie. Set back and hold on to something, you are going to love this from beginning to end. The only thing wrong with this movie, is the waiting for the next one.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~22 May 2005~The beginning~I am a fan of the book. I admit it right here in the beginning. I have also been waiting for someone to turn the books into a movie or movies since I first time saw incomplete animation by Ralph Bakshi.Then some years ago I began to hear rumours, that a director from New Zealand, Peter Jackson was about to take on this task. The name wasn't unfamiliar to me: I had seen his previous movies, Brain Dead, Bad Taste and The Frighteners. I didn't know what to think. I did like the movies, but then again he was a splatter movie expert, not fantasy.Then I watched them again, and I saw the visual tricks and camera usage he had achieved in those little films and I became more confident. The subtle fantasy elements in Brain Dead convinced me of his abilities. But still, I was little afraid: could he pull it off?Then, sometime later, after hours of studying rumours and leaked photos in internet I and my friend finally got our hands wrapped around the tickets, tickets to get us in one of the first viewings after the premiere around here where I live. My throat was dry and I was anxious to see the final product.Couple of hours later my friend and I left the theatre mesmerized. It had been more than we expected, light years above anything we'd seen before on the screen. We spent hours talking about the experience and we came in conclusion, that if the quality of the first film were a promise from things to come there wouldn't be anything to worry about.Besides of the stunning cinematography, music and special effects there are amazing actor performances seen all over the film: Ian McKellen as Gandalf, a wise old wizard who is leading the fellowship through perilous journey. Sean Bean as Boromir, son of Denethor, steward of Gonodr. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, corrupted head of the wizard's council. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, son of Gloin, a dwarfish warrior. Billy Boyd as Pippin and Dominc Monaghan as Merry, two loyal friends of Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Samwise (Sean Astin).Only two actors I didn't immediately fell for were Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, or Strider if you will, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. There wasn't anything specific in Bloom's case; the part just wasn't a huge acting part, mainly just looking pretty. In Mortensen case I was little bit distracted by his, perhaps little too calm at first, portrayal of Aragorn. But I got over it.The special extended edition didn't bring anything crucial to the movie, just some scenes adding more depth to the story, like the journey of the elves, where Frodo and Sam see the elves travelling in the forest, going towards the Grey Havens, in order to leave the Middle Earth.Fellowship of The Rings was and is extremely good start for the one of the most stunning trilogies of the movie history.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 January 2006~A beautiful film that never drags once~"I have never been a fan of Tolkein's works. Whenever I've tried to read them, I've become bored and have stopped bothering. It's taken me a while to get around to watching The Lord of the Rings, but I am very glad that I have now seen it. In fact, it actually made me read the books and I prefer the movies to the books.One of the things that I enjoyed so much about this movie is the absolutely *stunning* cinematography. Filming in New Zealand was a brilliant move and I am so glad that this was filmed ""on location"" instead of in the studio. I realize that a good deal of this movie is CGI, but it flows beautifully and there aren't any particular moments where you say, ""AHA! Green screen! Right there!""I truly enjoyed the performances given by the lead actors. Especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. His performance is authentic and he obviously strove to not only play, but *become* his character. Orlando Bloom is wonderful as Legolas and this is easily one of my favorite performances from him. Although in all technicality Legolas is a supporting character, he is an individual supporting character. In the fellowship, there are no other elves for him to be supporting, so in that aspect he is a very individual character, even if he is not the lead. Elijah Wood is good as well -- he does a wonderful job of capturing the simplicity of Frodo and his depressed emotional state. And more credit to Mortensen as well as Liv Tyler with their emotion charged love scenes. A rare thing in Hollywood, these scenes are more sensual then sexual -- a welcome relief from the modern Hollywood blockbuster that just screams sex.Many people aren't particularly wowed by Peter Jackson's directing ability. But I have to say that I think he did a wonderful job. Despite the 178 minutes running time, the movie never drags once. Jackson did a good job of getting as much as he possibly could out of his actors and that is easily the film's biggest asset. This is an amazing film and everyone should see it."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~11 March 2004~Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10~While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/? ~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~12 February 2002~Peter Jackson for best director!~I know it's my second time writing a review on Lord of the Rings, but this isn't it particularly about Lord of the Rings. As some of you have read my last review (it was only posted yesterday, so the chances you did read it) you could tell just by my one line summary that I loved the movie. This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind. One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy. I know there's nothing any of you people can do about it, but I just felt that Peter Jackson is the one who I think truly deserves Best Director.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~23 February 2003~Big Surprise~Before this movie was made, I had barely even heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When the movie came out, it got such rave reviews and looked so interesting that I was quite eager to see it. When I finally did see it, I was SO impressed. The story is absolutely enthralling, the special affects were amazing, and the acting was superb. This movie really got me more interested in all the actors playing the hobbits, and also Ian McKellen, actually to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed all the actors, especially, Viggo Mortensen(playing Aragorn). There is not one element, one scene in this movie, (in my opinion) that could use any improvement. I would strongly recommend this movie to any who enjoys the fantasy\science fiction, even if you have not read the books. This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 April 2002~Faithful telling of great story~One of the all-time great fantasy works comes to the screen in nearly-faithful fashion. For those of us who read the books, this is a very special treat. Special effects and music are flat-out awesome, acting is almost as good, particularly the characters of Gandalf, Aragorn and Frodo. Liv Tyler is also great in expanded Arwen role. A definite must-see.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~21 September 2016~immersive new world~Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring to rule them all. He loses the battle and the ring is lost. It passes through the hands of Isildur, Gollum, and finally lands with Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives in the Shire to visit Bilbo. Bilbo goes on a personal journey leaving the burden of the ring to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Frodo sets off on a quest to save the world with his best friend Samwise (Sean Astin). Along the way, others join this Fellowship of the Ring.Peter Jackson delivers a near-perfect execution of this fantasy classic. The CGI is state-of-the-art but the movie does not get bogged down with battles of massive armies. The action is visceral and thrilling. The characters are compelling and the performances are near perfect. The internal conflicts over the ring actually drive the narrative and ultimately generates great paranoia and isolation for Frodo. This is a great start.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~29 August 2002~A gargantuan filmmaking achievement~Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry. His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres. If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise. He now owns the second highest grossing film in history. Talk about a Cinderella story!This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson. It took eight years from inception to completion. He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out. Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two. They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three. He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record.Jackson's task was daunting. He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books. Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task. Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand. The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay.The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic. The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre. The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes.The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar. Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo. Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer. Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf. With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast. He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range. He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo. Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power.Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon. Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible. In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day. Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins. Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age.This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone. By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books. Still, at three hours, it never drags.It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal. It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages. One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released. I rated it a 10/10. It is motion picture history in the making.~10

If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, ""Winner of four 'Academy Awards', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination.""Reading the original J.R.R. Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy willingly - prepping with ""The Hobbit"", of course. ""It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish,"" someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.""The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm"" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable ""Lord of the Rings"" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well. At one time, it seemed impossible to think that such literature could be brought to cinematic form.******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom"~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~4 July 2002~quite simply the best movie made to date~From the casting to the acting, from the cinematography to the special effects, from the locations to the sets and props an costumes and makeup, from the wonderful film score to the truly excellent screenplay, there is hardly a fault to find with this breathtaking, amazing piece of cinematographic art. Director Peter Jackson and his superb, highly motivated cast and crew have done the seemingly impossible in turning Tolkien's beloved books into a movie, and they have done it so amazingly well - finding their own idiosyncratic interpretations while staying absolutely true to the spirit of the book - that all I can say is: Go and see it!! - if you haven't done so yet.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~2 March 2022~The journey begins~The Fellowship of the Ring is a masterpiece. Each character is unique, each moment is exciting, each scene is amazing. All those elements make a.magnificent movie.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~31 July 2022~Best of the Trilogy~"Without sounding pompous, Fellowship (cinematically) is the best of the three films. Many right-brain fans will deem the latter two as they involve more 'action' so to speak, but unfortunately deter from the lore of Tolkien's' masterpiece.Not only do I believe this is the best of the three, I believe Fellowship is one of the best films ever produced. It fulfills in my mind what a '10' movie merits: Perfect Cast, beautiful Cinematography , amazing Dialogue, Remarkable Soundtrack, and overall excellent direction from Peter Jackson where he paces the film perfectly, taking time with introductions but never boring the viewer.Gandalfs scene with the aesthetically CGI Balrog (which still holds up) stands alone as the best scene of the entire Trilogy--Ian McKellon's performance truly shines. Enjoy Frodo at his best before we are dealt with a not so heroic and quite annoying counterpart dealt to us in the sequels.To all fans: many older fans (50+) agree this is the best of the Trilogy. AFI selected Fellowship (and only Fellowship) in their 100 Years...100 Movies and in a half-hearted appeal to cast authority, Elijah Wood believes this is the best. ""Best"" was the focus of this review, not to dampen the brilliance of the latter two, but rather highlight the beauty this film holds.I have the Trilogy from best to not so best: 1, 3, 2 with scores 10, 9, and 8 respectively.-J."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~28 May 2023~A Masterpiece Extended: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is not just a film; it is an extraordinary cinematic journey that immerses viewers in a world of magic, heroism, and boundless imagination.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~23 January 2023~Full of Sound and Fury; signifying ????- The Fellowship of the RIng~I found the book more interesting than the film. The essence of the book, in my opinion, is not the fierce warriors or the battle scenes, but the buildup of the characters of the most helpless of all the participants in this drama, the Hobbit. Although having great music and cinematography, the film lacks soul. It is visually stunning, and the actors do a great job with the roles they are given, but the real problem is that many adults will just not believe the content. That is why the Hobbit is so important to both the novel and the film; it provides soul to an otherwise souless existence.Part of the problem may have been that the producers decided to take the easy way out and create a film for the senses rather than the mind or the soul. And this works well, once again, with younger audiences. Adults want more than just bells and whistles.? ~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~6 July 2010~"""For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all"""~"Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-03) is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time (perhaps second only to Sergei Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace (1967)'), and played such an immense role in my adolescence that the two years I had to wait to experience its conclusion were as painful as they were gratifying. I'm about to take you on a trip down memory-lane, so bear with me. I first saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' in late January 2002, long after everybody else I knew, owing to a family holiday that nevertheless allowed me to familiarise myself with Tolkien's primary Middle-Earth literature.I greatly enjoyed the novels, and have certainly re-read them since, but this movie was something else. I was immediately transfixed by its magnificent locations, exciting characters, epic scope, and, above all else, its attention to detail. Jackson's prologue gracefully traverses 3000 years of Middle-Earth history, settling finally on the halflings of The Shire, a race of little-people so satisfied with their quaint lifestyles that the goings-on of men and elves are of little consequence to them. It's this balance of the epic and the intimate that makes these films so special. Every time I watch 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I notice something different: the three frozen trolls of Bilbo's tale; the hobbits' hairy, shoeless feet; the glowing of Frodo's ""Sting"" blade whenever orcs are close.Each of the film's characters remain true to Tolkien's original stories. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are self-doubting but courageous, as yet oblivious to the roles they will play in shaping Middle-Earth's history. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) projects incredible power and wisdom, but it is infused by the weariness of an old man, the mental ravages of millennia passed. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a valiant wanderer, and the last surviving member of a shattered royal bloodline, an ancestry that seems to affirm his own downfall. Supporting stars Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, each contributing their own spark of personality into this magnificent world of fantastic creatures and terrific evil.Peter Jackson has asserted that his favourite film is 'King Kong (1933),' a prime motivating factor in his decision to direct his own excellent remake in 2005. Both films capture the awe and wonderment of their respective fantasy-worlds, though 'The Lord of the Rings' is even deeper entrenched in a sort of historical mythology, fuelled by a Tolkien legendarium that seems to stretch far beyond even the film's epic scope. We're all inspired by something. I like to describe myself as an amateur filmmaker, a hobby I've maintained for the best part of ten years. I'd already picked up a video camera by the time I saw 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in January 2002, but my prolonged enthusiasm for film-making came from the realisation that movies could be this amazing."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 September 2021~Simply perfection.~This movie somehow completely captures the magic of books and kicks off the trilogy. Everything about the cinematography is superb; the acting, the directing, even the music. It's an absolute masterpiece.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~4 March 2019~Extended Edition Recommended~A world so distant never feels so close. The Lord of the Rings is an immersive experience, taking you along a journey of emotions as you absorb the beautiful landscapes in New Zealand along with one of if not the most iconic scores in film history. Attention to detail in costumes is some of the highest quality seen in film history, and CGI still holds up to many modern movies and tv. While not an exact replication of the novels, LoTR is possibly the most perfect.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 December 2001~In one word all I can say is WOW!~I went to see Lord of The Rings today and my heart is still beating from excitement. My mind is still on high candy eye ! Peter Jackson has done the impossible in my opinion made a film that is better than Star Wars (which I never liked anyway). The action sequences are enthrailling, the scenery is beautiful and the storyline is so memorizing and attention grabbing you won't move from your seat. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, he's my pick for Best Actor this year. Viggo Mortsen as Stryder is a solider in this movie, he just goes G.I. style the whole movie. I can't wait for the second movie and to see it again. **** out of ****.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~19 April 2020~A Classic~Every six monthes or so, some desire rises and i find myself watching this movie. From musics to story, to visual feast, it fullfills every need a movie lover needs.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~25 May 2008~'Rings' proud and true.~My Take: Grand-scale epics at best.After plagued with much hype and anticipations upon release, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, the first of three adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series, is a highly satisfying and intriguing trip to a dark and yet magical new enterprise. New Zealand-born director Peter Jackson, like most of Hollywood's directors and producers, demand a great deal of money to create such project, but unlike others, Jackson has his own vision. He doesn't let the film blunder with too much special effects without first seeing what's more important, plot characters and storyline. With such great framework, it's no wonder why FELLOWSHIP is steady and strong.Firstly, the movie is filled with dazzling special effects. There are dozens of flashy advances on the effects. Now, we are able to create towers, civilizations, creatures, caverns, and many other locale and characters in grand scale. It's a convincing look at a terrific combination of miniatures, digital effects and the like. This is a grand motion picture achievement, and it's great to look at. This cost a lot to be sure, and it shows.But the movie isn't all flash and dazzle, it's also about characters and a story, and it doesn't water down Tolkien. His vision of Middle-Earth is wonderfully and respectfully visioned by Jackson, who takes his imagination to create it. The characters that populate the story are actually valuable. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his gang of Hobbits, and the rest of the Fellowship, comprise a surprising amount of friendship. These characters are a real fellowship, as we care about them, and what happens to them. The plot isn't tailor-made for Tolkien fanatics alone. The plot is easily explained and punctuated, and avoids much confusion.Although the adaptations of the follow-ups are more superior, it only shows that something great can actually be something even bigger. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is superb, epic-scale, with heart.Rating: ***** out of 5.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~5 April 2008~Tolkien 's famous trilogy in a live-action spectacle~"Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler; she gives Arwen's first scenes her sultry voice.In ""Fellowship of the Ring"" I love the first scene after the prologue: Frodo was reading beneath a tree when he heard a male voice singing. He runs to see who it is and finds an old man (Gandalf), wearing a grey cloak and a pointy hat, driving a cart filled with fireworks and suchlike. When the cart stopped, Frodo said, ""You're late!"" Of course, Gandalf does not look at the hobbit at first and then turns slowly with an emphatic expression on his face that begins to twitch, and he says, ""A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to."" Then they both (he and Frodo) slowly began to grin and crack up into laughter, and then Frodo leapt on the cart and hugged the old man and said that he was glad to see him. Another scene from the film I like is when, after Frodo was stabbed and Arwen took him to her father in Rivendell, she faced the Ringwraiths at the Fords of Bruinen and cast a spell on the river to ""wash"" away the Ringwraiths. I also love the romantic bridge scene in Rivendell between her and Aragorn; they're my favorite book couple. I am fickle like that."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~9 June 2004~"""All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you."""~"The beginning of the great Lord of the Rings epic. The ring of power is discovered in the hands of hobbit man Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), the title character and hero of JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", who then passes it to his nephew Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) pulls a few strings to bring together the various races of Middle Earth to join in a quest to destroy the ring. Along the way many will fall and many will live, but the fate of the world all rests in the hands of Frodo and his companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Joining them is a burned out ""ranger"" who is actually the heir to one of Middle Earth's finest kingdoms, Aragorn, AKA: Strider (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean) the troubled son of the Steward of Gondor, elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Ghimli the dwarf (John Rhys Davies!) and two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Billby Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, respectively). And don't forget Gandalf the Grey.A great long road movie of a fantasy that could easily have been made boring is kept alive by the direction of Peter Jackson, who didn't stay nearly as close to the books as the inept Chris Columbus tried to stick to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books but somehow delivered a far better film, capturing the spirit and humanity of Tolkien's work. Wood is sometimes annoying and sometimes endearing as Frodo, so I give him a 6 out of 10. Astin, Monaghan and Boyd are all fine as the other Hobbits. McKellan and Mortensen shine as Gandalf and Aragorn, with Bean working hard to make you sympathize with Boromir even though may not like him. Davies makes the most of his Ghimli role while Bloom has little to do except stand around and look pretty. Hugo Weaving really stands tall as Lord Elrond of Rivendell (far more engaging than his Matrix work). As for Liv Tyler as Arwen, well, to me Liv will always be Bruce Willis's slutty daughter from ""Armageddon"". Liv's work here is fine, but I do feel that they were kind of using her face and name as a battering ram to propel the advertising campaign. She isn't bad but it's a shame that she overshadows the work of Miranda Otto as Eowyn in ""TT"" and ""ROTK"" and that Christopher Lee, who played the loathsome Saruman with such quiet malice, was cut from the 3rd film whilst Liv was kept in.Great sets, great costumes, great props, great locations, and great music by Howard Shore. Don't miss Enya's ""May It Be"". Look for odes to the animated versions of Lord of the Rings here."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring~14 January 2005~"""it has some interesting elements"""~A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.~4
Forrest Gump~10 June 2002~Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump~"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10"~10
Forrest Gump~14 May 2007~In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....~"Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.868 out of 1,036 found this helpful.

Forrest Gump~7 April 2006~Pure Charm~Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film.The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.~10
Forrest Gump~19 May 2016~Dropping My Keys~"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.I can't help it."~9
Forrest Gump~8 April 2002~A beautiful fable for now and the future~"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"~10
Forrest Gump~22 December 2012~The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...~"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made.Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it."~10
Forrest Gump~15 December 2007~Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire~"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!"~10
Forrest Gump~31 May 2004~Purity and innocence retained~I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.? ~10
Forrest Gump~22 December 2015~a box of chocolate~more than adaptation , it is a visual parable. about vulnerability and its magnificent potential. about innocence and its importance to discover the real essence of life. about love, family, fight and courage. a film like a revolution. because it propose the best manner to be yourself and to not be a victim walking on that way. more than story of Forrest Gump, it is the story of people around him. a film like a Rubick cube - many faces, each for complete right color. and a image who remains its mark - the box of chocolate, the run, the ping - pong match. it seems be the best role of Tom Hanks. in fact, it is definition of a new period after the Cold War. a pledge. about the small things.? ~0
Forrest Gump~1 December 2007~Quite possibly the best movie ever made.~"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing.Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made."~10
Forrest Gump~25 December 2020~Encapsulating...~... all that is, all that was and all that will ever be, through the life experiences of the titular character performed to perfection by Tom Hanks whose generous performance leaves us humbled and in awe of what we can achieve, how we can achieve it and why we would want that achievement in the first instance. A piece of cinematic storytelling that will perpetually resonate no matter who or what you are, where you are going or who you are going with - timeless.? ~10
Forrest Gump~22 January 2023~Thirty years on, and it's still as wonderful.~A very eventful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.Tom Hanks, we all know just how good an actor he is, but there is something about his performances here that's extra special, he is simply outstanding. He's given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.It's funny, it's moving, it's wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It's a long film, but it's one that simply flies by.The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you'll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it's a terrific soundtrack.I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn't appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it's a captivating watch.Keep on running Forest.10/10.~10
Forrest Gump~1 April 2000~One of the best films of the 90's~Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas.And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves. Well done, well acted, and well directed to pythagorean procision. A++? ~10
Forrest Gump~12 February 2021~Mama said ...~Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.If you can dig all that and go with the flow, than the chocolate box this opens up for you, will taste quite delicious. It had been quite a while since I saw this the first time, but it still worked its charme to say the least. Great movie, great actors - you have to be in the right mind set and mood though. And be able to forgive certain things ...~10
Forrest Gump~13 February 2010~The Hand Of An Unseen Providence~"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different.The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it."""~10
Forrest Gump~20 June 2005~The zen of Forrest Gump.~This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.~10
Forrest Gump~25 May 2005~Life's Lessons in one Movie...~When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...1,079 out of 1,201 found this helpful.

Forrest Gump~18 December 2003~Neither as good or as bad...~People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea. But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that. The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here. Sinise was excellent as well. Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie. But then, she fell asleep during Casablanca, so....~7
Forrest Gump~9 September 2014~After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!~When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years.~10
Forrest Gump~22 December 2006~Tom Hanks' best performance~This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful.? ~0
Forrest Gump~18 January 2020~Impressive film~It's a feel good film, that's not a bad thing. In this modern era of sequels and reboots, films like Forrest Gump offer an escape. I still believe Pulp Fiction was the better film for the best picture Oscar, but this is still an incredible film. Touching and heartwarming storyline leads our central character through some important moments in history. One of a kind film, that was not followed by a sequel. Tom Hanks is the foundation here, but is surrounded by a great support cast.? ~10
Forrest Gump~11 May 2016~A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.~Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended.~0
Forrest Gump~3 January 2000~Revisionist history:- after only 30 years.~"The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were ""Unamerican"" in every sense of the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either."~5
Forrest Gump~1 November 2019~I liked it, but I did not love it~I get why so many people gush over this movie, I really do. I have watched it quite a few times myself. It is good to kill a few hours and be entertained. It ain't great though. The overwhelming emotion I feel for Forrest is pity, as he is strung along and used by the object of his affections. This is a decent movie, perhaps one of the best from Mr. Hanks, but I do not feel it deserves as much hype as it gets.? ~6
Forrest Gump~4 November 2014~American History Through The Eyes Of A Simpleton~"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), eludes him.This film is fun, funny and touching, if not a little bit sad. If a school wanted to (and no doubt some have), it would be an interesting way to teach the second half of the 20th century. Elvis, Wallace, the Kennedys and more.This is probably the film that ""made"" Tom Hanks. Although he was already big in the 1980s with ""Big"" (no pun intended), this was probably the turning point where he went from comedy to serious actor (well, somewhat serious). And it probably remains his most-watched movie of all time (well, besides maybe ""Sleepless in Seattle"").? "~8
Forrest Gump~15 November 2013~Tale worthy of Frank Capra~Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. It's his journey through American history. His childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. His journey is heavily influenced by his mama (Sally Field), Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), and Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson).Director Robert Zemeckis has added another chapter to the American mythos. It is a magical tale where the good guys win out. That you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. That a good heart will enlighten all it touches. It is a tale worthy of Frank Capra.If I could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to Gump's journey. For example, he's given a chance to comment on the Vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike. I would have like to hear what he had to say. But that might have been asking too much. More than anything, Gump is not controversial.~8
Forrest Gump~3 October 2020~American history book + fairy tale for adults~Of course I heard about this famous 'Run, Forrest, run!', and how Forrest Gump is the best of Hanks' acting career. However, I'm telling you this was not my kind of movie according to basic information provided. It has one narrative which happens to be biographical. My first thought is that 'Forrest Gump' will be another linear story talking about one character throughout the whole movie. Linear story lacks dynamic and bores me. Second, it is very AMERICAN, the stuff only hollywood clique will enjoy. I keep myself away from the literatures that emphasize patriotism too much.However, this movie does not bore me a bit for 150 minutes. Even though Gump narrates his whole life from the childhood to fatherhood, it feels more segmented. By cutting each chunk of life story and getting back to Gump in the bus station back and forth, it feels like the movie is giving the audience break after each session. I get to refresh and sum up at every scene of Gump at the bus stop. Also, supporting characters are unique and powerful, making the movie more dynamic. Rather than having many insignificant supporting characters, the director chooses to select and concentrate on three. Then, the audience can hear about the full story of Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan, sharing the story with Gump.Even though there were many American historical moments, they were just necessary to develop along with Gump's story. AND it was funny to see Presidents and Elvis alive again with visual effects. Life lessons given to the audience are not just for Americans. Many countries go through conflict, turmoil, and destruction, and 'Forrest Gump' concentrates on what choice an individual, Gump, makes during those historical chaos. I cried a lot watching this movie because every character was me, my parents, my grandparents, my neighbor, and my heroes. Gump's warm heart really console me at difficult times.~10
Forrest Gump~22 March 2022~Nearly perfection~"It's hilarious, and it is tragic.Tom Hanks is...amazing as Forrest Gump, striking the balance between ""stupid"" and ""normal"", as many choose to describe people.There's parts where you can feel how sad it is, but it's not crammed in there, or overpowering. It strikes the right balance with the comedy.Somehow, this movie has found a way to be underrated, as it has 70% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics.? "~9
Forrest Gump~10 June 2000~No one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American public~"This is a ""cute"" movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say nothing of technologically advanced. Let's face it, this guy Gump knew everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a ""dull normal"" in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!? "~6
Forrest Gump~18 September 2013~Uplifting & Wondrous Fable.~"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump in Robert Zemekis's Academy Award winning(Best picture, director, & actor) fable about a simple and honest man who finds himself floating through life like(the ever-present) feather in the wind. He is often bullied growing up, but finds solace in his best friend Jenny, whom he comes to love dearly as they get older. She tells him to ""run Forrest, run"" and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt. Dan(played by Gary Sinise) whose life he saves, giving him a medal and inspiring him to be a Ping-Pong champion, where he meets three different U.S. Presidents, and later becomes a multi-millionaire by investing in ""a fruit company"" that takes off in a big way. He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again...Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it. A truly marvelous achievement by all."~9
Forrest Gump~15 February 2013~delicate silhouette~it is a beautiful film . for the slices of silence. it is a delicate work. for the unique performance of Tom Hanks. and, sure, it is a snow ball on the evening of Christmas Eve. in fact, it has not definition. only lines of feelings. and crumbs of childhood manner to discover the world. so, it remains magic and fascinating. because it keeps state of time and create another, very original form of line between reality and fiction. profound face of small things. and a travel to yourself with the others as borders. a fairy tale. and source of a form of emotion who remembers the real value of life. its purpose. its fake limits. form of deep freedom. axis of all - a delicate silhouette.? ~0
Forrest Gump~5 September 2005~I used to love this movie.~"*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers ***Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already."~6
Forrest Gump~12 January 2020~It's good, but don't get your prop in a twist~Not the best movie ever made people. This thing is flawed, but also kind of magical and amazing. Worth watching, but not the best thing ever.? ~8
Forrest Gump~16 March 2009~The Ultimate Fad Movie~"""Forrest Gump"" is the ultimate fad movie. It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation. It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history, and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important. But all these years later, this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable.The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion. It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.Grade: C-"~4
Forrest Gump~12 September 2002~Technically Brilliant, Otherwise Barren~"Yes, I watched in awe as Tom Hanks was digitally inserted into all the major events of the second half of the twentieth century, but my already opened jaw then went slack at the banality of the screenplay.Sorry, but ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" is not a philosophy for a grownup. Or even a retard.I loved the opening shot, and was really wanting to like this film, but Sally Field is embarrassing, ditto Tom Hanks. Gary Sinise is good, but Robin Wright's character makes no sense.There IS no moral or philosophical coherence to this film ... it just allows woolly thinkers around the world to project their own feel good mantras onto it.I give it a 5 for technical achievement(I stand by for the usual tirade of illiterate and obscene abuse I get when I dare to criticise a sacred cow.)"~5
Forrest Gump~20 January 2014~Even The Mentally Challenged Can Be A Master of The Universe~"Almost Anyone can become Amazingly Successful in America, just Look at those who have run for President and Vice President of the United States and some have Actually Won. Arguably not Our Best and Brightest.This is Excellent Entertainment, but could be Dangerous Entertainment. It's like those Infamous Subliminal Messages you Hear about that Enter the Subconscious without Your Consent or Knowledge. In this Movie nothing is Hidden, it is Unabashedly Up-Front about its Intent.This is a Fun Film but be Advised. It has a Political and Social Agenda. In one of the First Scenes the Audience is shown how Forrest got His Name. From one of the Founders of the Ku Klux Klan. And We're off and Running.Gump's Unanswered Love for His Sweetheart Jenny is Hammered Home throughout and She, along with any other Liberals are Treated here with Contempt and Her Behavior towards Forrest Gump is more than Contemptful, it is Hateful until the Bitter End in this ""Sweet"" Movie.If this Film is Approached with just a Little Cultural Awareness and Realize that it is Manipulating the Audience on All Levels, it can be Enjoyed as a Philosophical Point of View on any Number of Subjects. But the Filmmakers Know that most Folks are not that Discerning and Therein Lies the Danger."~8
Forrest Gump~30 September 1999~Good if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge~The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'. ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show'). Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'. I took this as a deep personal affront. I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront. It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long. Ah, well. Life imitates art.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue. Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing. The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply. He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on. (If only a bomb had landed on his foot. It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.~2
Forrest Gump~28 June 2007~Overrated melodrama~"Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext ""In America""). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours ""disease of the week"" performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" - why did that get overlooked?).But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special."~4
Forrest Gump~3 November 2020~Forrest Gump~A great movie, its great story and the story of Lieutenant Dan was sad, but I think it does not deserve the Academy Award for Best Film. I really enjoyed watching the movie and hated the character of Jenny.? ~9
Forrest Gump~11 March 2014~"Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in ""Forrest Gump"""~"YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutesI haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiancé at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two."~9
Forrest Gump~14 February 2010~...And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump~I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.~10
Forrest Gump~4 March 2017~Gets Better Every Time I Watch It~"When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with ""Gump"".For a very basic summary, this movie tells the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple mind, touches so many others.First and foremost, this is a movie that perfectly captures the angst of the Baby Boomers generation. Throughout the course of the film, everyone takes a stand on something and refuses to budge. Jenny is a hippie, Lt. Dan has a death wish, and even Mama Gump is okay with her boy selling out for U.S. ping-pong. The ultimate point made, however, is that such behavior cannot last forever and eventually one has to find their true self. That's exactly where Forrest comes in, as he never loses himself to begin with. Despite his simple mind, he ""knows what love is"" and shows it to everyone around him, even when they are using him for various reasons. In a swirling, turbulent world, Forrest is a bastion of self-awareness (ironic, as his awareness in other life areas is so low!).In order for all those things to work, it takes the acting performance of a lifetime--exactly what Hanks is able to give. There may never be a more deserved Best Actor Oscar given to anyone, as he perfectly nails both ""goofy simpleton"" and ""emotionally self-aware adult"", often in the the same scene. As many juicy themes as there are for Zemeckis to work with, this is as much a Hanks masterpiece as anything elseOverall, ""Forrest Gump"" is no less than landmark cinematic effort. It captures the essence of Baby Boomer social struggles and does so in ways that make it timeless. Much like Zemeckis' earlier ""Back To The Future"", it is also a film in which not one scene is wasted. There is something interesting to either behold or ponder in quite literally every frame. Every time I watch this movie, I appreciate it a little bit more."~10
Forrest Gump~12 September 2014~Sincere and Sweet~"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives littleat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are foughtyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and naïve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybeor maybe it's just great filmmaking."~9
Forrest Gump~4 February 2015~7 Year-Olds Give The Best Movie Reviews Ever~Can't take credit for this gem. Even if I am her mother.Forest Gump: Movie review by JosephineSo, it's about this really stupid grown-up and there's blood and stuff and it's not appropriate for anyone else in my class, probably, but, you know, you guys let me watch stuff like this. What is up with that? And there's this really bad girl named Jenny, and I hated her clothes. But once she cuts her hair she turns good again. And a guy with no legs, who was weird. He made shrimp, which is gross, except for the popcorn kind. He got a lot better when he cut his hair, too. I liked it. It was funny. Can I watch it again tonight?? ~10
Forrest Gump~18 April 2010~Sometimes American Movies Are Like a Box of Gooey Chocolates, and Gump is Pure Sap: One of the Silliest Movies to Win Best Picture~"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so.A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why I avoid them."~3
Forrest Gump~8 October 2006~Like the chocolate in a box, my feelings are mixed....~"(r#79)I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn't an extremely well made movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. The ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but I still can't help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. There are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself.The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and I loved both ""Sling Blade"" and the more obscure ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"". In the former, Billy Bob Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, Bad Santa. In ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"", Stellan Skarsgård was also utterly believable. But I just can't buy Hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsgård, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human and real as you and me. Hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He's just too goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. I did laugh at Gump's cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just ""Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"".Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'Gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way.This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. On the surface, ""Gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. At least Hanks and Sinise do their best."~7
Forrest Gump~30 June 2002~Surest Way to Win an Oscar~"Make a movie about a retard, or play one. Look at Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or Miles in ""Ryan's Daughter"", they won Oscars for playing retards too. You can't go wrong with a stupid person as the focus, sort of like the chimp lead. Better yet, endow him with all sorts of savant-like talents like superhuman strength and sports agility. What silly, contrived hokum. This is a sentimental piece of schlock that is always simple and forced. ""Life is like a box of chocolates"", yeah, right! The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth. It proves that pop culture really sucks. ""Pulp Fiction"" was it's dark Oscar nominated rival in 1994. It was a better movie with a sicker message so it lost to this treacle,? "~2
Forrest Gump~25 January 2020~Must watch!~An absolutely remarkable film about a decent, humble man who throughout his life met a few presidents, fought in Vietnam, was a professional Ping Pong player and ran around the whole country of America while also meeting celebrities like John Lennon and Elvis Presley. A truly heart changing film that will change your life forever. After all this Forrest had an I.Q of 75 but that didn't stop him.? ~10
Forrest Gump~12 August 2015~A good movie but it's not the masterpiece that many say it is~This is a good movie for what it is but I really don't know why people say it's one of the best films ever made.Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he has accidentally been present at many historical events. While sitting on a park bench, he tells strangers about what he experienced in life and the people he met.The musical score is well-done and perfectly timed. It hits all the right notes at the right time. It does a great job drawing different emotions out of the audience.Also, I think that this is a very entertaining feel-good movie. It is also pretty compelling. It has a nice message as well. It's message is that you can achieve all you can in life. It can inspire many people and it does a great job doing what it wanted to do. However, then there are the flaws.Firstly, the movie often gets crippled under its own sentimentality. I get that the movie was trying to draw emotions out of the audience but it does it too often. Its sentimental moments can be real overwhelming at times. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending seemed to exist just to add more unnecessary sentimentality to the movie.Also, this movie is overlong and stretched-out. It could've been cut down a lot. Several scenes I felt could've been cut down or could've been completely left out altogether. I grew bored several times throughout.In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie and I like it for what it is. I just don't think it's anything special like many people say it is.~5
Forrest Gump~26 August 2022~Exquisite warmth~Delicate and warm American theme. The different fates of Forrest Gump and Jenny are almost a mockery of the affirmative action movement in the 1960s, and Forrest Gump's burial of Jenny is also the burial of America's own history in the 1960s. The writing is beautiful, the editing is clever, the monologues are soulful, and Tom Hanks' acting is flawless, but the film's values are dubious. So divided.? ~6
Forrest Gump~10 December 1998~why I think this movie stinks~"first of all, I've only seen this movie once, but I was actually very offended by it. It takes itself far too seriously. The commentary embedded in the film's core, relating to the 60s revolution and drug use in general, are shockingly naive, reactionary, and simple-minded. This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as ""simple truths"" much like its foggy-headed main character. Not so. It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues. This movie is for people who voted for Reagan.? "~1
Forrest Gump~30 May 2016~Real Message~My friend suggested me to watch this movie. I didn't expect anything out of it, just wanted to pass some time. After the movie ended, I felt like I had never seen anything like this before.. It even made me write a review. Such a beautifully made movie, has got everything. Teaches you about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our life as granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tells you how to realize and work with all that you have, no matter how you are. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and his life. Not only through the eye of Forrest, but a mother, a friend and general people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come across is exceptional, and all you will leave behind is love and respect. Magnificent movie.? ~10
Forrest Gump~15 February 2016~No one does it better than Tom Hanks.~Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man.? ~9
Forrest Gump~2 September 2001~A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.~"Once again, I watched ""Forrest Gump"" for Christmas. While it isn't a ""Christmas Movie"", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine.Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way ""A Wonderful Life"" has become a classic."~0
Forrest Gump~11 September 2003~Only In America~I remember the BBC coverage of the Oscars in 1995 . Barry Norman was asking the Brits in Hollywood - Among them Tracey Ullman and Alan Parker - what they thought of the years nominations and the British view was unanimous that FORREST GUMP was nothing more than an overated mediocre movie . After seeing the film for myself I`ve got to agree with the standard British view - This is an overated mediocre movieIt`s impossible to believe anyone outside America could love this movie . The overated ( Third time I`ve used that word in this review ! ) Tom Hanks plays Forrest the local town idiot who experiences many of the truimphs and torments of 1950s 60s and 70s America , and it`s all produced , played and written in a sickly sweet way , so sickly sweet you should watch this with a bucket in your hand so you don`t get any vomit on the carpet.Amazing fact . Both American and non American voters on this site give FORREST GUMP an identical voter average - 8.1 . I`m at a loss to explain this~4
Forrest Gump~6 February 2002~"""Bye Bye Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country."""~I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big').Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10~0
Forrest Gump~25 July 2002~How is Gump ageing?~"I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it had improved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance! The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically the film is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sickly and insubstantial.In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents of social change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If it wasn't so nauseating it would be funny.Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars, when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly and morally bankrupt its a disgrace.Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book ""Vietnam War Movies"" wrote; ""Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worrying is that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give this evil little film a U certificate. How can we protect our children against such insidious brainwashing"" How accurate an insight."~3
Forrest Gump~5 April 2002~Jon Monsarrat review: an overly sappy soap opera~"I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.Who should see this film:-- Soap opera fans-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do havean artistic film school depthI'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout. If you don't like the first ten minutes, stop watching."~2
Forrest Gump~16 September 2004~Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film~"FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell.Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write ""Imagine"" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob."~0
Forrest Gump~1 May 2019~The 10/10 Gump~One of the best films, well portrays the 60.70.80 years. It shows various social movements in the United States, discussions about loyalty and love of neighbor. 10/10 cinema masterpiece with certainty? ~10
Forrest Gump~29 September 2001~"Forrest has ""gumption""!"~"Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy.In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" Although it had been some seven years since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once ""loved that movie."" When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been assuaged.By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen ""Forrest Gump."" At least once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. ""Forrest Gump,"" when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness follows.My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl! Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... ""HALLELUJAH!!!"" Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, ""Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should be!""And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest ""touches"" everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world.I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" She spurred me to watch it once again. Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do. Peace and love to you, Forrest."~10
Forrest Gump~9 April 2023~Not a fan of this movie~"Over the years I had often heard how great the movie ' Forrest Gump' really is or was and it's one of the best movies ever made. My mum on the other hand thought it was boring. Over the years I kept switching back and forth as to whether or not I really wanted to watch this movie because it didnt look appealing or something I'd be interested in other than iconic pop culture line of ' Life's like a box of chocolates"" thingWell I finally decided to watch this movie. How bad or good could it be, right? Well sad to say I didnt like this movie at all, it was boring and dragged on for too long throughout the story. I get what ' Forrest Gump' is trying to tell - appreciate the little things in life, what really means most to you and being the best that you can be even when life slaps you in the face. I get itIm just not a fan of it and that's ok. A movie can have great meaningful lessons and themes to take a way especially if it really touched you but eh if the story is such a drag and so boring, then my interest or the movie's likeability is completely out the windowThe character of ' Forrest Gump' is ok. He's wholesome, humble, simple minded, kind and not smart but means well. But eh didnt think he was all that interesting of a character. I dont know, this movie and the character itself didnt click well with me. If I had to say one good thing is the relationship between Forrest and Jenny, they both clearly loved each other but due to the traumas Jenny suffered as a child she felt unworthy and kept running away until finally overcoming her demons and accepting Forrest's love. The different paths they choose before that with Forrest somehow doing well and Jenny not so much was interestingBut overall this is not a movie I think I would want to watch again at all. Not a fan."~5
Forrest Gump~24 September 2007~That's one special man...~I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.~10
Forrest Gump~2 March 2009~Best Picture Oscar winners are like a box of chocolates.....~Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10~9
Forrest Gump~22 January 2019~Might be the Greatest Movie Ever Made~If not, it's in the top 10 and a true masterpiece.Revisiting it after over ten years, it still hits hard with so much heart and excellent writing and acting by Hanks and Wright, as well as another unforgettable role for Sinise. Might be the only movie that can make you cry and laugh out loud at the same time.There are many morals of the story, but one that seems universal is to make the most of life with what you got. Not everyone is privileged or handed things easily and people have different unique traits, strengths, and weaknesses, but you can at least make the most out of your life even if you have disadvantages. Forrest doesn't make excuses and does what he can.Wish they still made Oscar winners like this. Miss the good old days of pure filmmaking.10/10.~10
Forrest Gump~29 June 2010~One of the best films of the 90's.~"""Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him. Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like. It's a classic in every sense of the word."~9
Forrest Gump~16 March 2006~The Good & The Bad Of Forrest Gump~"Wow, I found a number of ""good"" and ""bad"" in this movie, too much to go into detail here without writing what looks like a novel, so I'll condense my thoughts with notes here. I don't expect many to agree with me but overall I found this good very good storytelling and a film that stays with you.The GOOD: 1 - a totally unique story back when it was released and still that way, unlike anything else I've seen; 2 - an involving story. You really care about the lead character ""Forrest Gump,"" who is magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout, with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all ""peace and love;"" 8 - a sweet, tear-jerking ending.The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock is just fine is not a good message. (""You didn't do anything wrong, Forrest,"" says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.Overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics."" Maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a negative light. That's too bad. I owned this DVD and got rid of it. I'm sorry I did because I'd watch it again and I've seen it three times. Love it or hate it - you don't forget it."~8
Forrest Gump~31 March 2008~Watchable, with the right expectations~What I mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but I wouldn't pick it either. It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clichés and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive. But the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat.~5
Forrest Gump~3 July 2009~Overrated And Unbelievable~"The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal ""Bosom Buddies."" Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many ""good"" and ""upright"" citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better."~1
Forrest Gump~30 January 2022~Just no~The film isn't terrible...it's actually a pretty well written movie with amazing characters...the thing that irritated me most about this film is the fact that Forrest had to wait for a woman who didn't want him in her prime only for her to settle with Forrest until she was past her prime, abused and all used up. That was just not fair on the main character...I don't care if you guys here on IMDb have a different opinion, or you don't like what I am saying ...but fact is fact. That is why I will never like this movie....very overrated, bad, and definitely does not deserve to be in top 250 movies of all time on imdb....? ~2
Forrest Gump~27 March 2021~Great flick~Great flick. Have to say anything under a 7 rating are just kids posting to goof around.? ~9
Forrest Gump~10 July 2014~Not my favorite but the Best I've watched so far~"This is the only film for which I can use the word ""Beautiful"" without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story. And about the academy awards, open your mind."~8
Forrest Gump~20 June 2003~Absolute Garbage!~"I hated this movie when it came out and I still loathe it. All the people in the audience I saw it with were ""oooo-ing"" and ""ahhhh-ing"" at this cornball, manipulative, simplistic garbage. I notice now, nearly ten years later no one talks about this movie at all. Krap is as krap does...Hollywood garbage posing as ""art"". Ugh...save me from stuff like this... What's strange is the Zemekis' next movie, ""Contact"" was Excellent. It's one of my favorite movies. Go figure...? "~0
Forrest Gump~1 October 2011~Simply one of the Greatest American Films ...~"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""Forrest Gump"". There are no villains in ""Forrest Gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget ""My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump""? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""Run, Forrest Run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix  ""Forrest Gump"" is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""Forrest Gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.This is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""Forrest Gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only ""felt like running"". Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is"". On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!"~10
Forrest Gump~2 December 2001~Disappointing is the very least I can say~"I was chided for not having seen this film...now I can chide back. I really shouldn't be writing about it since I DID NOT see the whole thing. Yes, I had to turn the DVD off after an agonizing hour. What a ""cute"" movie, but that's all it is. And to think academy voters chose this stupid, egotistic film over Shawshank Redemption. It's a sign that Hanks has way too much academy pull. Great actor but the film comes up short. Don't be chided into renting this thing.? "~0
Forrest Gump~21 April 2009~A magical and powerful celebration of life. A true classic.~Every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this – in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. Forrest Gump is a classic that will look handsome in any DVD collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older I get. A true classic.~10
Forrest Gump~29 April 2021~Amazing move all well acted~Best film story and perfect acting by all. You connect with all the characters. Emotional and funny yet entertaining. Gary Sinise will always be 'Lt Dannn!!' to us. Unforgettable and Unbelievable.? ~9
Forrest Gump~11 June 2013~A Perfect Film~Wow. An incredible film. I watched many other movies of Tom Hanks, Now i understand that i made a great mistake by not watching this movie this long. This is such an epic. Terrific acting by Tom Hanks, dint knew that he was this versatile. The film just creates a very good feel inside you that even after watching it just hangs within your mind. Gump is spontaneous with great talent even though he looks retarded. Every scene in the movie drags our full attention into it, by the spontaneous actions of Gump. The movie's BGM is also perfect and syncs nicely with the scenes. Everything, everything is perfect for this film. Such films are extremely rare. This should have been a multi Oscar winner and indeed, it is. Watch it. No other words. Just watch and feel.? ~10
Forrest Gump~29 March 2020~Iconic~I like the bit where he drank all those dr peppers and had to do a wee? ~10
Forrest Gump~14 June 2006~Read the book, avoid the movie~I read the book and saw the movie back in the 90s when both were out and popular. The book was wonderful. The movie was pure junk!All the darkly sad and darkly humorous parts of the book were completely chewed up and regurgitated into pablum for the masses, so that Forrest Gump the Movie would be the feel-good experience of the year. Which it was, apparently. The masses are stupid.If I was the author of this book, I'd be pi**ed at this movie.This review requires 10 lines, but if I were to write more, it would be to give too much of my valuable time to this crappy movie.But I want to warn intelligent viewers out there who might not have seen this clap-trap yet, to avoid it.So I will try to accomplish 10 lines via the return key.Do I have 10 lines yet?Edited 9/20/96 - adding 1 star to this; I've seen the worst movie ever made (Crash-1996) and it's a true 1-star; no movie deserves to be in the same class as Crash, therefore I am adding 1 star to all my previously rated 1- and 2-star flicks.~2
Forrest Gump~8 December 2000~Preachy, Simplistic, and Sappy~"Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan.Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime.This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way through to the ""resolution"" with Jenny at the end.With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.Watch this film and ask yourself ""What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?""Forrest seems to have made the ""right"" choices and been at the ""right place at the right time"" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?"~4
Forrest Gump~3 August 1998~Like a box of chocolates~A much more likable character than the one in the original novel, Forrest takes us on a surreal tour of every major event in the period during the birth of the civil rights movement and the anti-war era. He is so simple, open, and direct, that the audience can't help but like him. The film is at various times funny, sad, exciting, and moving. Tom Hanks so personified this modern Huck Finn that he well deserved his second Oscar.? ~0
Forrest Gump~18 July 2023~A recent day classic...~"One cannot dispute that the 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump"" is indeed a relatively modern day classic. And it is one of those movies that everyone is familiar with.Writers Winston Groom and Eric Roth put together something very unique and memorable when they concocted the script and storyline for this movie. And it is indeed a very memorable movie, one that actually leaves a lasting impression and impact on the viewer. Even now in 2023, ""Forrest Gump"" is still a movie that very much holds its ground and proves even as enjoyable and entertaining today as back in 1994. So thumbs up to writers Winston Groom and Eric Roth on that accomplishment.And of course the impressive acting performances put on in the movie were a big part of making the movie so beautiful and memorable. Tom Hanks simply is phenomenal in this movie, and he shines in every single scene that he is in. The movie also have some great performances from Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field.The character gallery in the movie is great as well, another testament to the writing skills of Winston Groom and Eric Roth.I do believe that ""Forrest Gump"" is one of those type of movies that will forever stand as a watchable and enjoyable movie. And that certainly makes it a very good movie.My rating of director Robert Zemeckis's 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars."~8
Forrest Gump~28 May 2019~Complete Drama~It is a complete drama..but if you watch this Iam damn sure that this will be a complete entertiner too...and the perfomance of Tom Hank will blow your mind? ~10
Forrest Gump~17 May 2007~A story that contains all~This is the ultimate movie. It contains within it all of humanity and human history, wrapped around one special guy: Forrest Gump. Gump is clueless to this fact, he is just looking at the moment or forward, and in the process he changes history and fates of humans around him to the better.I recall no other movie that has satisfied me as a human in such way as this, in both drama, comic and thrill, with a manuscript that seems god-made in it's completeliness.Only a few other movies ever made, can get close to Forrest Gump, if you ask me!? ~10
Forrest Gump~23 April 2023~Precision-tuned to win hearts and awards~"Not having seen ""Forrest Gump"" for decades, the online cynicism really started to take hold with me; the American mythology, evil Jenny memes and the obedient simpleton messaging; it put me in a weird headspace for this particular rewatch. But here's the thing: it's just so well-made.No one in this move feels out of place and most of the humor lands as intended. It's not hard to see why this movie swept the Oscars and ticket sales; we're talking Hanks and Zemeckis here, it was a '90s dream team. I'll admit I kinda checked out during the cross-country running scenes, but I was right back in when Haley Joel Osment showed up (it's all heartstrings from there).If there's anything about the movie that doesn't work for me, it's the people around Forrest; most of them end up either sick, ruined or dead, and I had a real problem with that. Jenny fares the worst here, and she honestly deserved better. I hate her father with the power of a thousand suns.I get all of the criticism over the years, I guess I just don't agree. This is by any measure a good movie, and my rating would probably be higher if I wasn't so sick of hearing about it. My brain tends to lump this in with ""The Lion King"" for that reason."~6
Forrest Gump~24 February 2002~Ridiculous~This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous accents, too many special effects, unbelievable story. The high point is young Haley Joel Osment as Gump Jr, and it's only at the very end of the movie that we see him.? ~1
Forrest Gump~5 November 2005~A thoroughly nasty piece of work~This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw it away.I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work, how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office success and win multiple Oscars.Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work. I still hated it.~1
Forrest Gump~24 February 2016~One of the best cinematic works of our time~Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?~0
Forrest Gump~6 September 2023~A unique & wonderful modern-day tall tale~Much like the titular character, Forrest Gump is such a unique movie. It walks, or rather runs, the fine line between drama and comedy so effortlessly that it doesn't feel jarring when the tone shifts. Plus, I think some may have forgotten how groundbreaking the visual effects in this film were. Tom Hanks is unforgettable as Forrest, and his performance made an impact in pop culture that was almost as big as the many cultural & political events portrayed in this modern-day tall tale. It's a wonderful experience to see a timeline of our country's history through the childlike eyes of Forrest Gump.? ~9
Forrest Gump~4 June 2001~You're dumb...~...but the USA can make you rich, healthy and famous with the minimum trouble to make this a pure Hollywood movie. Should I say that this movie, though cast is okay and directing conventional, is much overrated. This movie seems made for a religious and puritan American audience, and it received here in France a particularily mixed opinion. Script has to my mind many flaws, music is irritating, and again I completely disapprove the meaning... so watch it (once only) if you have time and make yourself an opinion but don't think you are going to watch a wonder just because of its 6 academy awards! 6/? ~6
Forrest Gump~17 December 2020~Simply one of the absolute best movies ever.~Seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it just gets better, even tho i dont know how thats even possible. Tom Hanks is THE actor of actors. Simply Amazing. Life lessons movie for sure. Also yeah, the 90s was so much better..I hope this world shapes up. Thanks.? ~10
Forrest Gump~15 March 2016~A man with a mental disability lives through and takes part in many points of history.~Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever to be shown on the silver screen and only solidified by a stellar performance by the cast and crew. One of the few films everyone can say they have at least seen once, this movie deserved every Oscar it won and will go down in history as one of the best and well-done films ever to be created. Many can say that this film does have some very minor issues, things such as the questionable moral depicted by the love interest, Jenny, throughout the course of the entire film. Some could take umbrage with the less-than amazing special effects (though the time of production should be added into context).? ~8
Forrest Gump~21 June 2001~One of the best of the 90's~"I have seen Forrest Gump about 15 times, and every time it drives me to tears. It shows how a man who is not exactly ""right"" can be very successful and lead a full life. I hear people all the time criticize this movie, but why? How can't you love this movie? Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas. Tom Hanks pulls in a great acting performance as Forrest and their are other great performances, also. Too many of them to name. It deserved that Oscar. I feel that wholeheartedly. I give it an A+.? "~10
Forrest Gump~11 September 1998~Will be classic in years to come~"Forrest Gump is one of the best films Tom Hanks has done. In this 1994 film his portrayal of Forrest recaptures the sprit of his classic performance in Big (1988). The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse turning in performances that deserved Oscars. Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R. Hall who plays Young Jenny will probably forever be associated with the line ""Run Forrest Run!"")In conclusion, a film which given time to mature will be a classic.? "~0
Forrest Gump~30 April 2021~Uff great movie, many memories with this one! one of the GREATEST MOVIE of all time~I cried in this movies more then once and that will be my review!? ~10
Forrest Gump~5 January 2007~Simply Unmissable and Totally Unforgettable~This movie is the story of a little boy with below average intelligence, but with a heart that's worth far more than a few little I.Q. points.Tom Hanks delivers this outstanding character to the screen and his performance is truly captivating; just like the story of his life. The beautiful Robin Wright brilliantly portrays Forrest's most cherished friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny. And this review wouldn't be complete without thanking Gary Sinise and Sally Field for their wonderful contribution to this truly heartwarming experience.Forrest's story sees him touch the hearts of the entire world with his simple innocence and strong will to do only what is right; making life better for many people along his journey.Forrest Gump is a movie that you feel as you watch, you will empathise with the character of Forrest, sharing his experiences whether they are humorous, heartwarming or tragic. And along this journey you will learn a great deal about life and its many twists of fate.Good enough to inspire everyone, even the most cold hearted among us.10/10 Unmissable, Unforgettable, Brilliant~10
Forrest Gump~6 May 2022~A Cinematic Masterpiece~This is one of the best movies ever created. It's absolutely flawless. The way it's written, filmed, produced, acted, etc is just sensational. It's more than a movie, it's a monologue of US history and major themes/events. One of the most impressive movies you'll ever watch.? ~10
Forrest Gump~22 April 2023~Is criticizing this movie a sin?~No matter what I say here, it won't matter. People see this movie as a classic, and I respect that. But despite the raving reviews, I was not in love with the concept; Forrest Gump is a ridiculous series of events, portrayed seriously.The accents, the outcomes, the behavior? Ridiculous. Yet its tonality is serious... Its message? Serious. Now, perhaps the humor was just a miss for me, and there is something comedically appealing to others, or perhaps celebrating mediocrity is truly that moving to some. But in neither case was this film redeemable for me.The pacing was slow, and to be honest I was a bit bored. But I sat through slow burns before, such as The Shawshank Redemption, and that was a far better movie. And with a much better message, plot and delivery.I feel like I'm desecrating someone's grave here, but I stand by it. I've witnessed much more compelling storylines, acting and cinematography than this. So, 5/10 for me, but I know my opinion is unpopular and most will think differently.~5
Forrest Gump~13 July 2004~Gomer Pyle meets Rudy...~"It doesn't really surprise me that so many people think Forrest Gump is a great film... it only reconfirms my feelings about the average filmgoer. Simply a poor man's Zelig (that's another film for those who don't know) that's been dumbed down to reach the television audience. Anyone who really believes that ""Life's like a box of chocolates..."" is too naive to even be reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections were confections and some excrement. Don't mean to sound bitter but live a half century (with your eyes open!) and see if you don't agree...by the way what type of chocolate did it taste like to you when you saw the world trade center collapse? Gump is Gomer Pyle who can't sing...and before you rush to defend...it's been 10 years and what were Zemeckis' other great films?? "~0
Forrest Gump~18 November 2010~Magnificent~"To say it with a cliché: they don't make 'em like this anymore. ""Forrest Gump"" is pretty much everything that was great about 90s cinema and more. It's incredibly long, but it isn't boring for a second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they're fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they're slow and horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president. Everything just feels right in this movie, the script doesn't have a word too few or too many. If you haven't noticed, to me this is one of the best movies ever made.? "~10
Forrest Gump~19 December 2020~An Exceptional Movie~This movie was something else, it perfectly captured an innocent man's life and it had the right balance of different genres. I really enjoyed watching it even though the ending was quite emotional.? ~9
Forrest Gump~9 September 2019~Love it~One of the best movie but iam not gonna give it higher than 7 cuz it told us a story not living it if you know what I mean? ~8
Forrest Gump~1 June 2001~A totally overpraised movie, and basically for US people.~Well, leaving aside the sad memories this movie brings me - which don't have anything to do with my overall point of view, I would like to express how annoying Forrest Gump results to me. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been premiered in the rest of the world. I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it, though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because the word had been out that they had to.I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.Five out of ten, and that's being too fair.~5
Forrest Gump~6 September 2014~It's a classic for a reason~Forrest Gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.Rating: 10/10~10
Forrest Gump~19 June 2014~One of the best films of the nineties~"1994 was a pretty good year for film. Along with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" we got ""Forrest Gump"", an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. Popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the Best Picture Oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year.The story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted Alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. From inspiring Elvis Presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), Gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. This tour through American history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in American history will also get a kick out of it. However, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. The central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does Gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends.That being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. Tom Hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. His performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive Best Actor Oscar. The rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. Sally Field as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright as his long-time love interest and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan all gave awards-worthy performances. Also worthy of note is Mykelti Williamson, whose relatively small role as Bubba was nevertheless highly memorable.In terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. The story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ILM's Oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted Hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. Throughout, Alan Silvestri's Oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs.Ultimately, though, ""Forrest Gump"" is not without its detractors. Some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. I don't agree with that at all. The movie's poignancy is well-earned and Gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life. In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, even considering its tough competition."~9
Forrest Gump~5 December 2017~Forrest Gump is not just heartwarming, it is a triumphant cinematic work of art with Tom Hanks exercising the role of his career~"Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field).This movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. It is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. Forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in America's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. Each scene following Forrest in the midst of the political tension including the Vietnam War, the ill-fated JFK administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. Flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see Robert Zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. Of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. The separation between him and Jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. And thanks to Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. Robin Wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. However, this comes less of a surprise than Tom Hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. Hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. Luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. He is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only Robin Wright, but his friend Gary Sinise as the well-acted Lieutenant Dan works well.Forrest Gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. For a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. I guess it comes to show that Forrest's mother was right when she said ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."""~9
Forrest Gump~10 December 2019~Good~Forrest Gump was good. It probably deserves higher, but I thought it lost steam these past few years. I still like Bubba Gump and the whole bus thing.Good movie. Recommend!7 stars? ~7
Forrest Gump~2 November 2002~Simple yet elegant~Leonard Maltin is usually right on, so I guess he can be forgiven for totally blowing this one (and for missing Animal House). Sound and Fury-esque story of idiot savant Hanks, not the sharpest tool in the shed but capable of some simple observations about living. And he gets to make a lot of observations across several decades of an eventful life, in a true tour de force by Hanks. Trick photography, placing Hanks with celebrities of the times, doesn't overshadow main tale of Hank's life-long romance with troubled Wright. Solid supporting cast is highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for Sixth Sense's child star as Forrest's son. Detractors may be taking this movie too seriously, I don't think it means to be that pretentious. Few movies in the last 50 years are so simply and beautifully told; just sit back and enjoy the story and the soundtrack. P. S. Years after writing this I came across Forrest's last lap just outside Monument Valley and did my own re-creation for the camera. It was a special moment for me.? ~10
Forrest Gump~19 May 2019~A charming romp through modern American history.~For the longest time, I had only seen pieces of Forrest Gump (1994). After watching it in fits and starts, I finally sat down and watched the whole thing in one go probably ten years ago. Upon re-watching this Best Picture-winner, I realized how it has maintained its cultural appeal for so long. After all, it's not necessarily a story about a slow southern boy; it's the story of history and the story of America. That's not to say it doesn't have its faults, but they're relatively minor compared to the impact of the rest of the film.What's perhaps the most impressive part of Forrest Gump is the visual effects. From digitally inserting the titular character into archival footage to removing a Vietnam War soldier's legs, even knowing these computer-aided elements are there doesn't hinder how real they look. Although, being able to match the visual tone and style of several decades was equally as impressive. It's almost laughable how one character could be a coincidental part of so many iconic events of the late 1900's, but I suppose that's a lot of the charm of this film.My one qualm with this movie also aligns with the spot in the plot where I generally used to stop watching. When the main character starts running across the country with no apparent supplies (water, food, etc.), my suspension of disbelief was broken. If anything, it was only meant as a chance to show off American geography (and move the timeline forward a few years), whereas the previous two hours was primarily American history. Some might also fault Jenny's (Robin Wright) poor life decisions as well, but I think it's merely indicative of what can happen to people who are sexually abused as children.A charming romp through modern American history, I give Forrest Gump 4.5 stars out of 5.~9
Forrest Gump~29 April 2007~Fun, funny, and even educational, but depressing.~Was Forest Gump made with the intention of being a depressing movie? I don't really think so. I think it was made with the intention of being sad at parts, but ultimately a feel good movie that was supposed to be quite funny at parts, entertaining, and even educational...not to mention a great soundtrack.For me, the movie was all those things, but unfortunately, I found the film, throughout all these jokes and happy moments, to be depressing. For a guy who doesn't cry much at movies, I bawled at this one.I don't really know what my point is...I was sad.10/10.? ~10
Forrest Gump~13 December 2019~"""Culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant"""~It has been 25 years since I saw it in a movie theater upon its original release back in 1994. I am glad I finally had this opportunity to watch it again after all these years. Robert Zemeckis is a great storyteller and Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field all achieve outstanding performance. Forrest Gump won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing. It also won many other Awards and Nominations, including Golden Globes Peoples Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards.? ~10
Forrest Gump~1 May 2004~Keep your rotten chocolates~"I can't believe this insultingly stupid, trite, and flabby film was nominated for any awards. The film is simply meaningless, having no comprehensible point of view and unwilling to look one millimeter past the surface of any of the events it attempts to depict. Something like this is even more flatulent and offensive than action garbage like _ConAir_, which at least doesn't pretend to have Something To Say.The popularity of this movie escapes me completely. I guess it makes people feel good about themselves in some sick way: ""My life is bad, but lookie - this retarded man gets to interpret the highlights of American history and popular culture for me!"" Hanks, who I normally like, seems to have based his performance on not blinking, or maybe he was just drugged (a rational response to the uber Hallmark Card that passes for a screenplay.) Wretched garbage appropriate for people scared of thinking.? "~2
Forrest Gump~10 December 2011~An amazing life. An amazing movie.~"Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as Forrest Gump. He's such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what ""smarter"" people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have been the smartest one of all."~9
Forrest Gump~16 January 2020~Its Just One Of The Greatest Masterpieces Of All Time.~A Beautifully Told Story. Portrayed By One Of The Greatest Of All Time. And Masterfully Executed.Forrest Gumps Story Is A Once In A Lifetime.? ~10
Forrest Gump~18 June 2020~Run!~"The life and times of changing America through the eyes of simple man. A lovely and warming film with Tom Hanks as the lead character telling the story of his life and how things have changed around him. Gump leads an extremely full life but despite everything he does; going to war, going for a long run, inventing crazes, playing sports, meeting presidents, catching shrimp - despite everything, all he wants to do is be reunited with his childhood sweetheart Jenny. It's fair to say that when life throws a problem, he just gets on with it and does his best, showing the audience that it's not worth being down about big things, not when life is so wonderful and varied. Hanks shines and is somehow hypnotic as Gump, grabbing the audience and taking them for a ride. Robin Wright (it's only ""The Princess Bride"" folks!!) is brilliant as Jenny, making you love her and hate her in equal amounts. I also must mention how good Gary Sinise was as Lieutenant Dan - like Jenny I hated him and loved him in equal amounts. His character development is brilliant and goes to highlight that anyone can change. Furthermore, one of the messages of the film (amongst all the others), a small interaction with somebody could have a lasting effect on them - that's how Dan turns out after having known Forrest Gump.This is a pure and inspiration emotional rollercoaster of dramatic film. There are some tongue in cheek moments where factual history is manipulated a little bit, but it's easy to look past these and see a true classic of cinema. If you have not seen this, it is worth rectifying that and watching a true gem as soon as possible - perhaps bring some tissues though.9/10"~9
Forrest Gump~20 January 2021~The Bohemian Rhapsody of movies~Forrest Gump is a movie that tries, and succeeds, to be moving, adventurous, funny, heartbreaking, heartwarming and endlessly creative. As the movie weaves in and out of Jenny's tragic storyline it drags the viewer through the full gamut of emotions. Gump is probably Hanks' finest character, a man whose affable simplicity cuts through the chaos of life in a truly life-affirming manner. Beautiful storytelling.? ~9
Forrest Gump~23 July 2006~Obnoxiously politically correct, but...~In all fairness and all clichés and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level.If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack.However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is.The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film.Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable.6/10~6

Forrest Gump~15 May 2019~A sweet movie~I've seen this movie twice and I really liked it. It's cool to see Tom Hanks as the titular character in these different time periods from the 50's when rock was becoming popular to the 60's when there was so much division in the states (especially about the Vietnam war in which he would serve in at one point as well as the Civil Rights movement). The actors do a great job portraying their characters. Gary Sinese as the bitter veteran is sympathetic to watch and Jenny, Gump's love interest is a good example of a star crossed lover. This movie's heartwarming and just like a box of chocolates. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself.? ~9
Forrest Gump~20 August 2002~Redundant, Sentimentalist Crap~"For the life of me I will never understand the popularity of this movie. It is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic mess.The entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until eventually I just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching another minute. That gimmick consists of inserting Forrest into an historic event and watching him emerge triumphant. That the film repeatedly has Forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times in recent American history---Vietnam, segregation, the Cold War, etc.---is an insult to the people who lived through those times. To say that Forrest, with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually experienced the event into which Forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an affront to America itself.One of the greatest tragedies in its Oscar sweep is that ""Gump"" won for Best Editing over ""Hoop Dreams,"" a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage. ""Hoop"" is riveting for every minute while ""Gump"" drags on and on with superfluous scene after superfluous scene. Could that ""Forrest running back and forth across the US"" have possibly been milked any longer? This lasts 15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of time.And as for Forrest's ""soul mate,"" Jenny, this little slut is a despicable character who abuses Forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect. This character does not deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt.""Forrest Gump"" is woefully, abominably bad. Its main gimmick is cute the first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade comes crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (Hanks is an Oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both ""Cast Away"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"") and inept editing.In my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all Best Picture Oscar winners.Rating: 2/10"~2
Forrest Gump~3 February 2017~Schmaltzy and overly folksy, but works~Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple, slow-witted boy from the country. We see his life story, his simple home-spun sayings that get him through life and how he manages to nonchalantly participate in some of the most momentous events of the 1960s.Simple, but fun. Overly folksy and schmaltzy, but works. Not too profound but if you don't think too much, it's quite enjoyable. The weaving into the plot, and the footage, of actual historic events is wonderful to behold and adds a great comedic element to the movie too.Won the 1995 Best Picture Oscar, though certainly wasn't the best film of that year. The other nominees were fantastic: Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption and Quiz Show, yet the weakest of the five won the award. I guess the Academy wanted something sappy and simple, not something gritty or clever, to win.? ~7
Forrest Gump~4 August 2019~This is pure gold.~Forrest Gump has been one of those movies that stuck with me even though many years have passed since I watched it the first time. The journey through the life of the dim-witted but ever lovable Forrest Gump is just so touching, funny, sad everything you know from life is represented here in some way.To be honest, there are times when the characterization of Gump as a person with less the average IQ points can be a little too much, but if you look at it through the interplay with the characters he meets, then it becomes an eye-opener.Especially when he is sharing the screen with either his love interest Jenny, the war time comrade Bubba or his stern but loyal lieutenant Dan Taylor. Those characters stay with you in some way, because they are som well written in the context of Forrest's story. The fact that you don't always get on well just because you're smart. Life is harsh, but when it is, look out for your loved ones.And how the technicians managed to mix Tom Hank's person into that footage of historical events is still baffling. I had a blast watching it every time it appeared.Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. An undoubted masterpiece.~10
Forrest Gump~20 February 2019~Amazing movie~An amazing movie the acting was fabulous by Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) one of the best movies of all time and one of my favourite.? ~10
Forrest Gump~9 January 2001~Idiot Savante or Lucky Jinx ?~Forrest Gump is a wonderfully magical and enduring film of nostalgia through the eyes of one man who is so beat up inside that he doesn't mind getting rained on. Almost everyone he has ever met or known ends up with a fortune of bad luck (Elvis, Lennon, his mom, Bubba, the Kennedys, Wallace,,) as he further goes on granting good luck on others by creating or contributing to Elvis's movements, mooning, smiley faces, jogging, Watergate, Lennon's lyrics and the Chinese peace movement. The altering of the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person. There is a message behind this movie that suggests that we only gain personal fulfillment through trying to improve the lifestyles of the others on this planet. This is a movie meant to be watched over and over.? ~10
Forrest Gump~21 May 2022~It's all destiny!!~The film is emotional and moving. Tommy Hanks fits the role to a T. It's unbelievable how such an abstract and philosophical concept was made into a brilliant movie. Must watch for all confused souls out there!!? ~9
Forrest Gump~6 May 2004~Apparently stupid people can become millionaires by blind luck. Who knew?~"Everybody talks about how great this movie is. Will someone tell me why? So a stupid guy wanders through the world, saying all kinds of stupid stuff, chasing a drug addicted stripper, and by blind luck wanders into millions of dollars? Yeah, I can see why that's so popular. It seems like this movie would make more sense as an inspirational video for retarded people.Look! You too can be a success without the unbearable burdens of intelligence or talent. All it takes is ridiculous levels of luck.And what about the years of running? Years of running? What is that? It's just so ridiculous. Who does that? Who? And people follow him? ""I don't feel like running anymore."" You're joking. Who wrote this because they should really be crucified.? "~1
Forrest Gump~1 June 2012~Soul Searching 101...~Many of us go through our entire lives never really seeing the world. I don't mean the world in News reports, or on TV...I mean the beautiful world, the simple world, beyond the the hatred and dissatisfaction that assaults our senses every day. The beautiful and uncluttered world as seen through Forrest Gump's eyes.OK, enough flowery talk. This movie will mean different things to different people, there is no doubt in my mind. For some it will be seen as nothing more than a patronizing joke, a crude attempt to make people think our world should be a fantasy land. I feel sorry for them, as they just don't get the simple message that shines throughout the movie.For others (I hope we are a majority), we see Forrest as a gateway to our own soul. Forrest Gump experiences all the hurt, the hatred, the huge brick wall of insecurity that we all experience. Yet he continues on, finding a strength within to overcome all the obstacles placed before him...Maybe we aren't perfect, maybe we don't know all the answers, but Forrest Gump lets you know that we don't have to be perfect to see the beauty all around us. Just look! I find myself watching this movie every time I see that it is on...~10
Forrest Gump~5 March 2020~An unforgettable masterpiece -- do you even have to ask?~If you have to ask yourself why this movie is great, have you really watched it?Side note: As a history buff, I especially found great pleasure in the dedication that the directors had in showing Forrest Gump going through the eras of his times.5/5.Also, kind of found it funny that Tom Hanks went from Forrest Gump to full-Saving Private Ryan a few years later.? ~10
Forrest Gump~7 April 2003~A dullard's Citizen Kane...~Why do people love this movie? This movie is not only completely unrealistic, it's also boring. Almost everyone I know who saw this movie and wasn't middle aged said they liked the movie but it was too long and kind of or too boring. Does that make sense? When looking back at this movie, did it really give you anything back? This movie is illogical, stupid, pointless, and umm... like before I get too redundant, annoying. I was hoping that Forrest Gump would die in the war or like get hit by a car when he was running. That would have been hilarious and then this movie could have been up there with Toxic Avenger and Braindead. And the Academy Awards are a joke. They don't recognize really good movies usually, and I'm stil in shock that American Beauty won since it actually deserved an Oscar. I seriously think that Demolition Man or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better movie. At least Wesley Snipes had a cool hairstyle. Go rent a classic like Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice or C.H.U.D... Forrest Gump sucks and isn't he more like an anti hero? I'd rather have Leatherface or the Toxic Avenger, but who doesn't root for them anyway?~1
Forrest Gump~27 November 2019~A True American Movie~A True American Movie. A classic that should go down in history in American film.? ~10
Forrest Gump~1 May 2003~Fantastic Gump!~Tom Hanks' memorable performance as the ultra special Forrest Gump who does a lot of strange but fascinating things in his life such as; running across the United States of America too many times not stopping, saving a troop in Vietnam, playing tennis with himself and much more. The movie is so great and fascinating, inspiring and entertaining that you can't take your eyes off it.Beautiful and an very deserving Oscar - winner, huge and extatic! STARS: ***** 5/? ~8
Forrest Gump~20 September 2010~A Film Above Words!~"Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain't worthy enough for what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis's, Watch 'Forrest Gump', and you would yourself become a fan of this man and take your words back.IMDb writes: 'Forrest Gump', while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above words, my summary correctly copies that. It's a journey of a man left alone, it's his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud citizen.About 140 Minutes long, 'Forrest Gump' unfolds fearlessly. This is Robert Zemeckis's finest work to date. His cinema has never been so engaging before. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay provides liberties to it's historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump & Gary Sinise, as one of Forrest's important people in his journey, pack in performances, that can surely be described as, ""Tour De Force"". Robin Wright as Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her character.On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo, that sentence in Caps, is an understatement."~10
Forrest Gump~28 February 2011~"Forgive me for not seeing ""the greatest film ever."" I'm fourteen."~"Ever have that one film that you've been getting bothered to watch, and just because you haven't seen it people feel the need to hate you and bash you? Or maybe it's just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for people to understand. It's something only I understand.My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when people started verbally insulting me saying ""I'm not a real critic"" and ""You can't call yourself a critic if you haven't seen the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said ""OK! I'll watch it!"" The plot I won't waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to strangers while waiting for a bus. Can't get more simplistic than that.Forrest Gump has been called by people ""a masterpiece"" and ""a classic."" While I think it's a well made film, I don't think it deserved six Oscars. I also don't think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the face for not seeing this film. It wasn't truly amazing. In fact, no film is really ""amazing."" Even the favorite film I don't call amazing. When defining ""amazing"" you'll find it's definition is ""surprising greatly."" I've seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an ""amazing"" job teaching. The film I'm waiting to define ""amazing"" has not been found.The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing. That's about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked Shawshank better than Gump.As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think ""Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?"" One category Forrest Gump should've won for is ""Best Musical Score."" The film includes the catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It's definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic ""Free Bird"" which was used to perfection in this film.Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army, and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable character. Not an amazing character.My final thoughts on ""the greatest movie ever"" go as followed; it was a damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review this film I would've enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn't annoy me so much to review it I would've enjoyed more of what it had to offer. The damage is done. I bet even after I'm done with this review people will say I didn't do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for them; s**t happens.Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis."~9
Forrest Gump~23 October 2014~I liked the script because it was a movie different~"Tonight I fell over in the movie ""Forest Gump"". You probably have seen many of you.I saw her the first time when it came out in cinemas and touched me very very much. Asked one of my favorite movies, perhaps the most beloved.Not because I laughed with smart funny scenes, but because ""he spoke"" for all truly beautiful feelings. Love, friendship, faith, patience, sincerity, selflessness, kindness, generosity, hope. But for children traumatized souls, or how to squander our lives on meaningless things and pleasures and lose the chance to be close to those who love us really.Maybe I liked the script because it was a movie different from all the others and still is. I clever script. I loved the music of the beginning and end titles and interpretations of protagonists.But for many it was just a movie about a retarded. The felt ridiculous because it is ridiculous, such a person can accomplish such things in reality. And for other reasons.You have seen how you?"~0
Forrest Gump~18 June 2007~Charming Movie, Never Know What You'll Get.~This movie is one of Tom Hanks best performances. He plays Forrest Gump and he narrates his life about having a low IQ and meeting his love interest Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). This movie It chronicles Gump's experiences, by chance, with some of the most significant people and events in American history like Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and service during the Vietnam War. Ulimately, he surprisingly makes huge accomplishments like being honorably discharged from the military and leading a healthy and successful lifestyle. It sends a strong message that even some people with low IQ could achieve the greatest in life.Forrest touched the lives of many people, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, his successes like becoming a football star and saving the life of fellow soldiers are evidence of the superb acting, heartwarming events and awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the turmoil of the 1960s.Overall, one of the best films in cinema history and certainly worthy of its Oscar wins.Grade A~9
Forrest Gump~27 January 2020~Tom hanks at his natural consuming...~Tom hanks appears noble here. A true force of nature that is long standing, seemingly inept, yet really, hes taking it all in, and waiting to pounce. For EXample: when jenny leaves him the first time to walk the streets, hankS just stands there internalizing what is happening to him. He stares, blanked faced for a moment, as though he can see a thousand miles in front of him, attaining a capacity that a dog would have who is stranded in the winter. The dog having a double choice. Number 1: kneel before god as god bends pieces of metal with a mad face. Or 2: just be nothing in the world, just tell jenny she is unnecessary.? ~9
Forrest Gump~11 February 2001~I never realised a film could be so amazing. Forrest Gump was.~What can i say, another movie which shines through. A movie which deserved all the awards it got and brought us closer to the wonderful acting of Tom Hanks. Forrest Gump is amazing. Everything you could want in a movie Forrest Gump has, from the laughter to the tears to the brilliant acting and brilliant story-line and MORE. Robert Zemikis is such a wonderful director and Tom Hanks being the brilliant actor that he is, was yet again truly wonderful in this movie. A must see if you haven't seen the fantastic Forrest Gump yet. BRILLIANT! 10/10!? ~10
Forrest Gump~14 November 2020~Great~I am still young and so I believe that I will still see many films during my life, but I believe that hardly any film will surpass Forrest Gump, starting with the fact that it contains the best actor Tom Hanks manages to captivate the public in every film he participates in, they are added there with a beautiful story like the one in this movie (which shapes the character over time, making our charisma for Forrest increase) makes this the best movie I've ever seen, you know how to reconcile the moments of humor with some more dramatic moments, which makes the film exciting from start to finish.Film seen on the 13th to the 14th of November 2020.? ~9
Forrest Gump~7 August 2022~one of my favourites~This movie has a story in which there is not a particular group of people to dislike, rather more being characters you can't help but to root for them. This movie changed my point of view in the later life and what it's like to struggle sometimes in life, but with there always being a glimmer of hope.? ~10
Forrest Gump~2 August 2016~Excellent film, somewhat disappointing ending~This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade.8.5/10.~8
Forrest Gump~15 January 2021~An Absolute Masterpiece - The more you have experienced life, the better this movie gets~I've seen this movie several times since it came out in 1994 and every time I see it I have more respect for it than the time before. The story, the acting, the music, and the cinematography are all top notch, but this movie has a magic. It is a watch that brings us together and allows us to see what is really important in life. Follow what you feel when you watch this movie, this is one of the greatest parables ever written.? ~10
Forrest Gump~27 April 2004~"""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."""~Forrest Gump is easily a great movie. Tom Hanks played so well as Forrest, a shy but very understanding and good man. The plot was very well and got me through my problems. This might be the best of 1994, if not that, than it's one of the best. The tagline made people want to see this film and it did huge in the box office. This had action, emotion, comedy, and friendship which put people into a different outlook on life. I think every person should watch this film. You have to se it through Forrest Gump's eyes to believe the unbelievable. If your having stress over life, please see this film and you could change different personalities, totally. See this film!!10/? ~10
Forrest Gump~22 February 2016~Instant Classic~This film was an instant classic for me.They don't write scripts of this calibre any more, which is a shame.Tom Hanks is brilliant as the mildly retarded Forest Gump. The film takes you by the hand, and shows Gumps life and experiences, both good and bad, in his own words from childhood to adulthood.At the same time you get a basic look at modern U.S. history.It is heartwarming and sad, funny and satirical. Cleverly weaves in so many sub plots and ideas.Yet doesn't use excessive violence or bad language to relate powerful messages in a heartwarming story. A story all the family can watch.A cracking film you can enjoy over and over again.~9
Forrest Gump~19 September 2014~Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.~"Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.A story of a man, who had everything going against him and yet he did whatever best he could. And when you do your best in whatever you have taken upon, you would mostly succeed. And there in lies the story of FORREST GUMP. When you are determined, even Gods would come down embracing you. Look at that scene in which there were no shrimps and after the hurricane there is plethora of shrimps and they become millionaires.Yet, most of it is untrue and even hypothetical, like running coast to coast for 3 years. Even such fabrications will be loved and embraced, if we love this man called Forrest Gump. He does everything from meeting the president to running the whole of America to being a war hero and setting up his own business and becoming a millionaire. And did I say, this was against all the odds, he had, yes, he did not have legs and he got them back by running, he is mentally retarded, yet he proves all of them wrong by being successful in everything he does.Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, has given us one of the best performances ever and this is a great character in itself. I have learnt from wikipedia that Robert Zemeckis the director, deviated from the novel written by Winston Groom. Now, what he did as a the director was a good thing and that is what I strongly believe. I did not read the novel though, but I loved Gump the way he is, so I think the changes were good.Technically, I liked the editing, though nearly 2 and half hours long, it was not at all so boring. Also, the screenplay by Eric Roth was good. The direction, I loved it. Look at that feather fly from skies to Gump's feet and then fly away at the end, just a glimpse of what direction is. Special effects were great specially in terms of putting Gump with the presidents and even John Lennon, I just liked the way it was all done. Also, I loved the dialogue and what a piece of writing this was, you can turn simple things interesting by saying them in an interesting way, and this movie does that through dialogue.Above all, I loved Forrest Gump as he is and more than anything, I loved Tom Hanks as Forrest, this is a great portrayal of a character. From dialect, to walking style to costumes, everything was appealing and interesting about Forrest Gump.It's a 4/5 for a movie that is great in terms of characterisation of a man who has has a ""JUST DO IT"" spirit and for Tom Hanks who has given one of the best performances."~8
Forrest Gump~8 January 2007~overrated maudlin inspirational speech~"many people love this movie,some even calling it a work of art.however,i must respectfully disagree.i found the movie uninspiring,at best,at mostly one long bore.if you like your movies heavy on sap,you will like this movie.this movie at times felt like one long ""i'm okay, your okay,we're all okay""inspirational speech.if i want motivational advice,i'll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru. all kidding aside other than the film's heavy handedness,there are a few good thing about it.the acting was good,the special effects were decent.the best thing about the movie,however is its 1960's and 70's soundtrack.despite it good points,the movie is not worth recommending. 3/?

Forrest Gump~3 April 2019~Really intriguing movie~Watched this movie today and it's just another great drama movie. The plot was just very good and had you intrigued throughout. There's a lot of funny moments, but also some sad moments which were perfectly balanced and made the movie interesting. This is up there with the best drama movies that I have seen such as Shawshank Redemption. You should definitively watch this if you haven't done so.? ~9
Forrest Gump~14 January 2000~The most overrated film, possibly ever~This movie is okay, but seriously folks, come on...... It's not that good. It sure as hell didn't deserve the academy awards.

Forrest Gump~15 April 2019~Best inspirational and motivational film~Forrest gump was born as a slow witted child. He is rejected from various schools because of low IQ. But his mother is strong headed to give his son the best education which any normal child deserves. Forrest has some spine problem due to which he wears braces on his legs.

Tom hanks gave his most memorable performance.~10
Forrest Gump~20 July 2022~A story that has become a classic~"An amazing story, deep meaning, great acting, catch phrases, warm memories of the film - all this is ""Forrest Gump"". Full of events and drama, the film has collected an excellent collection of various awards: Oscars, Golden Globes and the British Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.The film looks easy, but at the same time makes you plunge into history. The hero of Tom Hanks is interesting and extraordinary, he is kind and naive. This is what captivates the viewer. He wants to help or even prompt, but as you can see, he copes very well himself. I liked the visual solutions. The creators of special effects masterfully inscribed Forrest in historical moments, ""introduced"" influential people. I remember when I first watched it as a child, I was very surprised that some historical figures were being filmed in the film. It's only later that you realize that all this is a matter of masters of effects.Forrest Gump, despite his problems with development, is very purposeful, diligent. He is a strong-willed person. Despite the fact that it was always hard for him - he was bullied in childhood and in adulthood, the young man did not give up, but showed himself to be the true creator of his destiny. Let him be incredibly lucky in many places, but Gump teaches us all to be strong and go to our goal, do good and love people. In our life, it's not easy to follow this.Actor Gary Sinise showed himself well. A little cheeky, loving to tell the whole truth, he is a great friend to the main character, becomes a victim of war, but does not lose faith in life, although he often swears at her.I like the love line in the movie. Forrest falls endlessly in love, has been helping his chosen one for many years, but she constantly leaves him. Gump, on the other hand, believes in the best, does not demand anything in return from her. He is sincere, kind and honest.Forrest shows the viewer the basics of the basics - treat people the way you want them to treat you. And this works quite well in his particular case. He finds real friends, adherents and even admirers. It's not just that the people of America start running back and forth across the country after him. And he seems to find in this a solution to live on. ""Run, Forrest, run!"" These words have sunk into his soul, and into our memory for many decades.The duration of the film is high, but it does not spoil the impression in any way, because the story is interesting to watch, to empathize with the hero. The film is beautiful, kind and sensual. After watching the view of the world changes, you feel some kind of warmth that this hero gave you. Even if you understand that this is still a film with a lot of fantastic things in it, but its main message has been heard.9 out of 10."~9
Forrest Gump~21 May 2002~Ahh, once in a while a great film like this comes along.~"FORREST GUMP was the best movie of 1994. Tom Hanks is completely endearing as Forrest, a simple guy shortchanged in the IQ department, who proves that brains aren't the only things needed to succeed in this world. The movie, beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a nostalgic sweep that will carry you away. The opening shot of a feather on its way to earth is enough to make you gasp aloud, and the movie is just barely underway. Forrest Gump is also a wonder of special effects, but the less said about them, the better. The trailer and promotional pieces gave away much too much of the story. Admittedly, this movie has more than its share of plot, as it covers the decades of the '50s through the '90s. It also makes numerous pit stops along the way to encompass the momentous events that molded the times.The Gump saga begins back in the 1950s under the cloud known as polio. Throughout the years that follow, Forrest must contend with his score of 75 on an IQ test, but the braces on his legs don't hold him back for long. Forrest, who sometimes brings to mind the innocent simpleton hero Charlie Babbit, manages to make quite a few surprising contributions to society without even trying. Sure, some of the movie is sappy, but it is served up with consummate skill and a loving heart. The supporting cast is cannily chosen. Sally (""You like me, you really like me"") Fields, who plays Forrest's mother, may hereafter be known as Sally (""Life is like a box of chocolates"") Fields. You never know what you're gonna get."~8
Forrest Gump~21 December 2017~Brilliant from the beginning to the end~It is a flawless film. Every scene has been well thought before filming and the execution is perfect. Robin Wright plays the layered character effortlessly. Tom Hanks is awesome and I am sure that no one else could have Forrest Gump like him. He runs and talks in a beautiful way. You devolop a liking for this character almost immediately. While telling the story of Forrest Gump this movie also tells us the story of United States of America and pays tribute to the most celebrated celebrities and heroes of those times.? ~10
Forrest Gump~20 January 2020~My favorite movie~I love this movie so much. It really shows what your mind can do, where it can make you go and to not judge people for what they may have going on in their lives. The good, the bad or the ugly.? ~10
Forrest Gump~20 August 2015~One of the Tom Hank's Masterpiece!!!!~"""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people."~8
Forrest Gump~30 January 2019~Amazing film~Funny, endearing, sad just an all round great film. The clips that have been edited to get Tom hanks in are brilliant. Just a really good film? ~8
Forrest Gump~12 June 2008~Repulsive~"Because my English is not quite up to the task, I'm going to borrow the words of another reviewer from the UK: ""a nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle"". Frankly I couldn't put it better - this is right wing propaganda at its worst; all the more so because it's wrapped in (mostly) competent directing and acting (although Gary Sinise's ""performance"" is frankly irritating). Sorry let me rephrase and apologize to right-wing people, who are entitled to their political views: this movie is (bordering on) fascist propaganda.There is so much to love about America, ""Forrest Gump"" brings out the worst in it. An insult to anyone's intelligence - I hope it gets remembered as the ""Leni Riefenstahl's movie"" of the Reagan area.? "~3
Forrest Gump~22 September 2018~Classic movie!~Watched many times and although nearly 25 years later it might be look a bit dusty now and the 90s CGI not as advanced as it is now, but is one of the greatest movies and one of the finest performances of Tom Hanks. Loved the narration and the interactions with various famous people , although again some of the CGI is dated. Favorite period in the movie for me was the Vietnam section. Its a long haul movie at 2 hours 20 minutes. I never really got the message that although he had the low IQ he achieved so much in his life. Quite the contradiction. He even comes across as autistic. Still a great classic 90s movie.? ~9
Fight Club~11 February 2020~A great movie you can watch again and again~Because you'll probably be confused the first time around. It's not a coincidence it stars some of the greatest actors of our time.? ~10
Fight Club~19 April 2014~Superb~Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.~10
Fight Club~28 July 2021~Crazy, Cult, Plot Twist, Awesome = Fight Club~I have no words about this film. This is masterpiece cult film.10 / 10.? ~10
Fight Club~16 December 2013~Welcome to movie heaven!~"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"~10
Fight Club~22 October 2019~An unpredictable movie.~Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.? ~10
Fight Club~12 October 2019~Crazy good~So rewatchable. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing the second time you watch it, very good acting, funny as well sometimes. Great movie.? ~10
Fight Club~31 March 2020~Delightful Romantic comedy~A lot of people I know have never even heard about this film. Good to see the system works? ~10
Fight Club~18 May 2010~You love it or you hate it, personally I loved it~Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox? ~9
Fight Club~14 October 2007~The things you own end up owning you.~"I wasn't prepared for an existential trip about life. I thought it was just going to be about fighting. I was wrong.The line in my title grabbed me because I have always thought about ""stuff"" and how it ties you down. People can't get divorced when the love is gone because of ""stuff."" People can't move to a better location because of ""stuff."" ""Stuff"" is choking us all.It is like the Kipling poem:If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss;then you will be a man!Besides, ""stuff."" we are chocked by consumerism; which may be the same thing. The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves? Hmmm.This film had brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, under the superb direction of David Fincher. It deserves multiple watchings."~9
Fight Club~3 October 2019~HOW THIS IS NOT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE MOVIE IS BESIDE ME~"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.I saw it again when I was 13 and just started seeing movies for what they were - a language. A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of ""the middle children of history"" generation.After that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.Still took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.It's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club."~10
Fight Club~10 July 2021~Go in completely blind~The movie is phenomenal. I liked every single actor, the story was great and had some plot twists. It kept me engaged thoroughly and I was never bored. I only watched it for first time in my life a month ago, and I suggest you to do the same if you haven't!? ~10
Fight Club~3 January 2007~It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away~I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways.? ~9
Fight Club~18 December 2018~Watch it atleast twice~Beleive me if you want to feel this movie to the core watch it twice . It took me twice to analyse that this movie was something much more than just awesome Brilliant acting by brad pitt maybe his best one, direction above par . There is something much more in this movie than meets the eye .. Watch it and find for yourself? ~10
Fight Club~26 December 2021~Not about fighting~Fight club is not at all what I expected, but I was surprisingly ecstatic about what the movie was. A terrifically made thriller that builds suspence and keeps you invested throughout the entirety of the film. Be warned the film is incredible through the first watch and provides a different perspective the second time.? ~9
Fight Club~7 June 2019~I study philosophy but this film took me for a ride~I watched the first hour and a half of this movie when I was 16 before I asked my boyfriend to turn it off because it was too dark. Now I am in my early 20s and I watched it until the very end, credits and all, and it truly is the best thing I've ever watched. I'm obsessed and I cant wait to watch it again. I reckon it will hit me even harder when I am older and I'm sure it will be just as fantastic.Everything from the plot, the acting, even the damn lighting of every scene is art. I cannot believe I was not pushed to rewatch it sooner. I writing this as 1am because I cant stop thinking about it. It will seep into my dreams and I'm not sure if that is terrifying or thrilling. Maybe both? ~10
Fight Club~10 May 2000~a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.~"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens."~10
Fight Club~30 April 2020~This is why we watch movies.~Fight Club does exactly what movies should do, blow our minds, make us ask questions of ourselves and our society, and all the while thoroughly entertain us. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are at their very best.? ~9
Fight Club~4 February 2003~Life-changing Fight Club~I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore!5/5~0
Fight Club~15 October 1999~A unique film~"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.L."~10
Fight Club~26 August 2020~The first rule of Fight Club: You never talk about how over-hyped Fight Club is~I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.? ~7
Fight Club~25 June 2000~It doesn't get much better than this~"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand. Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days."~10
Fight Club~11 August 2020~Revisiting Fight Club~Fight Club isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be.It really comes off as a pretentious piece of work for film students to study to the point of exhaustion, but I don't think it was ever intended to be that. The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.It's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.There's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.Without giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club. And I'm happy to be done talking about this one for a good long while.~6
Fight Club~2 March 2004~I am Jack's kick-ass review~To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be another mindless action film. But then something happened.....I actually watched it. I thought the movie was genius. It wasn't so much about fighting. It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia. Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly. Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep. With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems. I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10.? ~10
Fight Club~2 September 2010~Quite an accomplishment~"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the ""Fight Club,"" a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc. He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house. The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like ""Mulholland Drive,"" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.""Fight Club"" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending. Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job. Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.""Fight Club"" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film."~10
Fight Club~21 July 2018~This movie is overrated~"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit."~7
Fight Club~11 October 2018~G.O.A.T.~This movie is one of the greatest of all time. It is adapted from a book by Chuck Palahniuk. This movie has very interesting themes like emasculation, violence, chaos, societal breakdown, isolation, the threat of death and consumerism. The direction is sublime. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly. Also they did a good job with the inter-cuts. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were the perfect choice to lead this movie. When you are watching the movie you just are glued to your seat, that is just how good it is.? ~10
Fight Club~9 March 2021~Perfect Club!~This is the movie you must see before you die. Everything about it is bonkers. Very original. Don't expect just another film about fighting there's helluva lot more to it. This is what movies should be, leading you to the unknown of unpredictably. Shame it flopped at the box office, thats why great movies don't get made. Brad Pitt and David Fincher also did Se7en, definitely check that too. Both of the films are one of my all time favourites.? ~10
Fight Club~19 September 2014~A controversial satire and a contemporary classic. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11~Solid Acting and Amazing Direction A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness both geopolitical and especially economic, that would erupt globally in the decade to come. Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool. Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.Essential Hollywood film of 1999.? ~10
Fight Club~24 September 2001~Great Film: Deserved Several Academy Award Nominations~The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times. In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something. I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign. The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters. This is one of the most underrated movies I know.I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both. Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out.~10
Fight Club~1 July 2021~You never forget the first time you watch Fight Club.~This movie is absolutely amazing. It's got a perfect plot, perfect cast, perfect script, perfect twists, perfect ending, perfect everything. This is definitely David Fincher's best, the only other answer I'll accept when asked what his best film is is Se7en. Anything else, and you're just trying to be different. Anyways, I cannot stress enough how much I like this movie. It's my 4th favorite at the moment, and it has defo earned that spot. Once again, being a 16 year old dude, I was destined to love this. But weren't we all?I've already broken the first two rules, but this needs to be talked about: This is possibly the greatest twist in cinematic history. I did NOT see it coming at all, and when it happened I was shocked ngl. The way it was executed was perfect. It's one of those twists when it subtly hints at it the whole movie and when it finally reveals it you're still shocked.This movie is just made so well. No wonder it's one of the most cult films ever made. It's just too perfectly made, and it's stays with you for a while. Definitely will forever be one of my favorites.~10
Fight Club~26 May 2021~22 years later and still hits me every single time~This has been, and will always be my ultimate absolute favorite movie, the mind-blowing very unpredictable and relatable events is just so crazy, i've prolly watched it 10 times in the past 10 years alone and that's me being generous to my mind hoping that somehow I'd forget some parts of the movie.I wanna talk more details about the movie but we all know rule #1.? ~10
Fight Club~21 December 2006~Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there~Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.~7
Fight Club~27 September 2001~The things you own ends up owning you.~"What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course ""Dr Jekill and Mister Hide"" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,""a clockwork orange"" ,""rebel without a cause"" ""bad influence"" and Joel Schumacher's ""falling down"",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in ""primal fear"".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says ""the things you...""The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la ""sixth sense"" ,""Jacob's ladder"" or"" Usual suspects"" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of ""clues"":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying."~10
Fight Club~5 December 2007~A Pretty Looking Nightmare~"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.? "~5
Fight Club~30 December 2002~Visually stunning, conceptually brave and only the odd sag~Our narrator is a white-collar worker who has his life to a point it could be called normal. His home is decked out in the pornography of IKEA catalogues and he is professional. However he is somehow dissatisfied with his life as it is and drifts from various support groups faking disease just to get love and emotional outlet. A chance meeting on an airplane with soap salesman Tyler Durden gives him pause and, when his flat is destroyed in an explosion, he turns to Durden for help. Together they begin to move into a world that isn't commercially based, where pain helps them to feel more alive. Together they start a small group called Fight Club where men can experience the thrill of a fight without the danger. However the groups grow rapidly and begin to carry out subversive activities at large. When confronted by our narrator, Durden disappears our narrator in charge of a semi-cult group that is operating without his knowledge.I didn't get round to seeing this film until it came to TV in the UK recently. So over several years I had generally been told that it was a `great movie'  mostly by people who had HEARD it was a great movie rather than those who had seen it. So I expected greatness and was taken a little aback by the fact that this wasn't a normal Hollywood film but something much more worth while. The reason I'm surprised that it ranks so highly and did so well is that it requires concentration and thought. The plot is basically a comedy, making fun of us. That's how I saw it  that we are like the narrator but we must accept that this is our lives to some extent, to go to the other extreme is just as bad if not worse. It is a very clever story and it only dipped in quality at one point for me  where the clubs first begin to become something more sinister (more!) and move into terrorism.Part of the reason it was so well watched is the stars but also the very cool direction that made it stand out to the student generation as something deep (even if they didn't get the film). I think this ironic as they haven't hit the stage of our narrator and can't fully relate. However the direction is praise worthy and Fincher was the best man for the job. Full of clever shots and great images the film is a joy to see. The one flaw I had was the sincerity of the film. Many love it because it is anti-capitalist in nature, making fun of IKEA-love etc. The film is preaching to us about this (and the other) extreme  but most people watching and making it will be living that exact life! However this is minor and it became less as the film went on and mocked both ends of the scale.The stars do well and I wonder if they worried this would be too highbrow and flop? Norton is simply a great actor when given the material and he delivers here. Even with the more extreme actions (that aren't real) he carries them off as convincing. Pitt enjoys himself well in the joint lead although his character is basically one dimensional (for obvious reasons). That said he is very strong and takes you with him as he gets more extreme. Carter is a weak link to me and I never really bought her character. A shame as she is quite central but it doesn't spoil it too much. Support cast are good, but putting a face like Meat Loaf in a very unusual role just made him stand out and distract from the role.Overall this is an excellent movie. Even if you don't get it, it is still great fun to watch. It is a brave story to try in a Hollywood film and it is superbly directed, acted and told. Some may rave about it too much but it is well worth a look. If only out of interest rather than to change your life.~0
Fight Club~15 September 2020~Extremely Overrated~Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.? ~5
Fight Club~6 February 2005~Fincher's half~"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough."~5
Fight Club~29 November 1999~Probably the best movie of the decade~After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.? ~10
Fight Club~13 December 2000~Very, Very Ordinary~"Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in ""Fight Club"".Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in ""Legends of the Fall"", nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent.I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime."~4
Fight Club~15 February 2007~Wow, what a fun ride!~From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10/10~10
Fight Club~21 March 2003~Style over substance.~"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices."~3
Fight Club~10 June 2001~One of the Stupidest Films Ever Made~I saw this film at a free preview about a week before it was released and two years later I can still remember how angry I was wasting an evening on this drivel.The whole premise that these guys can't feel any emotion unless they're beating the hell out of each other is ridiculous and boring.I can't remember one thing I liked about this movie.Not the script,none of the performances,the editing or cinematography,nothing.Maybe this film taps into the current anarchist views and aspirations of whatever generation we're up to,but who cares?If there was a score lower than one,I wouldn't hesitate to mark it on my ballot.? ~1
Fight Club~14 June 2021~I haven't seen this in a decade probably...~There are so many little things to enjoy.The airport car owner is a joyful moment I forgot.It's different to watch their relationship knowing what we know now. Her attachment?I'm excited to see Lou again.Blockbuster Equivalent!Not the Macs!Oh man... I'm gonna get a shovel is hilarious.Lead salad... sounds unhealthy :)Strange this is only listed in the drama genre.~10
Fight Club~18 October 1999~A rare film that challenges the viewer to come up with his own interpretations~Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion. In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life. The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends. The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value. My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender.~10
Fight Club~15 April 2001~The Ultimate Cinematic Trip~When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my top 10.I won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger picture.The acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven, Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has a certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in the film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely. Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his role as bob.The direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark like seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.In closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a chance to see it.~10
Fight Club~15 February 2000~Generally positive comments~"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period. I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film. The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting. The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"". It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life. In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes. The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues. We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety. Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story. This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance. Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose. I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD. Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book. If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film."~10
Fight Club~6 December 2001~Brilliant Direction and Superb Acting~Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.~9
Fight Club~26 February 2015~435,000 people gave this movie a 10~It would be interesting to know the ages of the people who gave this movie more than 5 stars. I just cannot imagine they are older than 20, most of them must be between 13 and 17.The title of this movie made me avoid it like the pest for a long time, sensing it was going to be bad. Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably. And for one simple reason: childishness.Watching grownup men being constantly childish is simply not funny, much less interesting. Unless you are a redneck or not older than 17.~1
Fight Club~15 October 2019~awesome fight club oh we can't talk about fight club~Simply ground breaking story, music and action it is my favourite film watched it as many times as star wars and anytime it is on no matter if I have missed some I dive in because it is wonderful give it a go? ~10
Fight Club~24 December 2015~useful~more than a good adaptation. or a form of cultural revolution. more than chain of questions about life, its purpose, its direction, solution to every day crisis. a not comfortable exploration of solitude. a parable about the search of happiness and the answers to a too long and deep silence. a film who has as basic virtue the perfect cast. because it is the stage for Brad Pitt to proof not only the talent but the nuances of a character who is too fragile to not become a strange sketch. Edward Norton is the same and the science to transform his character in the perfect picture of ordinary man looking the chance to escape from himself is far to be surprising. a film about power who, more than brilliant adaptation, is a new chapter of the novel.? ~0
Fight Club~17 May 2013~Not what I expected. One of the best movies ever made.~I had avoided this movie as I had assumed it was 'Rocky Goes Underground'. Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie.Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism.~10
Fight Club~31 October 2000~Bloated, irresponsible, self-indulgent trash!~"Typically over-directed David Fincher nonsense.Is he actually able to direct a movie that isn't dank, grimy and depressing? There are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard. Perhaps they confuse the muddled and self-congratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful.I found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless. It became increasingly obnoxious and irritating. Edward Norton's character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally. If this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts. Granted, there is a lot of fake, unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at. Not everywhere is a dull, grey office or a miserable, rainy alleyway.It is also very, very slow. 139 minutes have never seemed so long.A lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no MAJOR difference to the story I like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society. This should have been exploited more. But we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics. But, the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me. I didn't find it ironic, subtle or meaningful. Sorry.The sub-text about man becoming primal again, and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives, is lost on me too. It's practically non-existent. I have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting. It was really rather boring.The DVD has a loads of features, annoying and headache inducing. Why did Fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hour-long documentary? The menus are confusing as is the multi-angle function on the 5-minute ""scene deconstructions"". Who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer? The movie itself is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2.40:1."~1
Fight Club~30 September 2022~Very better than Inception~Is definitely much better than Inception. At the moment, the rating of this movie is higher, but if it comes above Inception, I will no longer appear on IMDb. Because this movie is not science fiction, but it is ten times more effective than a good science fiction. And this is very important. A realistic film is so effective in terms of storytelling. You see, at the same time, there is a lot of complexity in it. And you can enjoy watching it many times. Brad Pitt is completely one with his role. And it doesn matter that the movie is criticizing politics. What is most important is the depiction of modern man, and it is one of the few films that is even better than the original book.Of course I am fan of Nolan.....? ~10
Fight Club~24 June 2021~Great second half, strong performances~There's a primal feeling to this film, and for a good portion of it I thought its testosterone driven story and nihilistic, violent excess was going to be a little too much for me to enjoy, despite the performances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It comes around nicely with a twist though, after dropping just the right number of clues along the way.? ~8
Fight Club~27 May 2003~Lame~I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out.? ~1
Fight Club~6 July 2021~Special~Yes. First time watching Fight Club for me. I'm glad I watched it at this particular time in my life though, because I don't feel like I would've truly grasped the meaning of this story had I been younger. This film does more than entertain the viewer, and that's for sure. It asks some tough questions about our world, but most importantly about ourselves. It's a masterclass in suspension of disbelief. The execution and directing by David Fincher allowed it to approach a most unique proposition with tact. For me it's a masterpiece. But that's enough for today as I've already broken the rules...? ~10
Fight Club~17 July 2022~The rule of the Club is not to talk about the club. Is it necessary at all?~"The movie ""Fight Club"" was recommended to me by many friends who saw it before me. ""An interesting story, an amazing philosophy, good actors,"" they told me. I agree only with the latter. The cast and acting are top notch, but there are a lot of ""buts"" for me.I watched the movie for the first time many years ago, and I didn't like it. Years have passed and relatively recently I decided to revise it, thinking that since everyone praises it, then most likely I did not understand something, I missed it. And I looked at Pitt and Norton again. And, you know, I suddenly realized that nothing was missing. The emotions were the same. Movies are not for me.Acting, as I have already said, is at the highest level. Edward Norton is gorgeous. Perfectly conveys a certain note of schizophrenia of his hero, who seems to be chasing a shadow, and the vis-a-vis is literally one step ahead of him. And it's interesting to see who it will be in the final.Brad Pitt perfectly conveys the energy of his hero. He is fast, decisive, confident in himself and his rightness. He's like a mentor to his new friend, played by Norton. You agree with him in many ways, but the whole film does not leave the feeling that he is fundamentally wrong.Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses. She always has some wild roles. And here she successfully fits into the gloomy scenes, accompanying the main characters. She manages the image well. He is both attractive and repulsive, causes contradictory emotions in the viewer. That's what's great about him.But when the film ends, you suddenly realize that the ideas they are trying to present to the viewer lead to nothing. A fight club where everyone can find themselves, their perfection, ideas about undermining the current world. Probably, someone will say that I did not understand the meaning of the picture. Let. I saw in this film the idea as follows: they are trying to impose on me the illusion of another perfect world, calling for the destruction of the current order. Blow up the houses, see how this world will be reborn.The finale of the film makes me personally regret the time spent, because it is illogical, even chaotic. It is shown that the accumulated anger towards everything unfair in the protagonist can lead to such a finale, he will create something that can blow up the whole society. But all this looks unreal, as does the general narrative.I love the main actors, they have many wonderful works, but I didn't like the work in this film, like the whole picture.3 out of 10."~3
Fight Club~17 May 2002~What a completely hollow pose this strikes...~If you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullible--even for a filmgoer. Never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist, soulless society by none other than News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch). These people are just toying with you--they're in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever (as is born out by the ending--the film goes...NOWHERE). Avoid this nonsense.? ~1
Fight Club~29 February 2020~So good but what an ending~I really hated the ending the whole movie was such a great thing but it dosen't deserve 8.? ~7
Fight Club~28 August 2001~One of the dumbest movies ever!~Yes, these days it's hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb, when people rave about crap like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix', but this must take a special prize. At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores. Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent. In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot. If you think the plot is original, it's not. The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp. They both certainly deserve it for their past (and future) 'work'.? ~1
Fight Club~21 May 2000~I could quite happily die than watch this rubbish again!~Have you ever had flu or food poisening and have been laid up in bed with a fever? you know the feeling, you loose all track of time , you are not sure if you have slept and your dreams drift in to real life. Have you ever been so drunk that you wish you were dead, the feeling is the worst in the world isnt it.? Watching the Fight Club is all these feelings rolled into one. i can honestly say this is nearly the worst film i have ever seen. i wont try to go into what the film is about because i could not tell you. This film last 16 hours ..or so it feels. Looking at the box it says 133 minutes. i would rather have spent 133 minutes sticking pins under my finger nails. What complete rubbish. Please don't watch it. 1 out of 10.? ~1
Fight Club~4 August 2021~Not my Cup of tea~I personally Fell it was not for me but movie has its own excellence terrific performance by leads and Good screenplay but I didn't get the Story waana watch it twice to understand.? ~5
Fight Club~15 April 2004~rejection of consumerism hard to swallow...~coming from cast members who've enjoyed multi-million dollar l.a weddings etc.if you're going to comment on issues as fundamental as this, then live the lifestyle. otherwise it just doesn't wash. you should leave it to someone else.pitt is also very unrealistic as a tough guy in this movie. his performance in snatch was much better and benefited from some humour. the chain smoking carter is also tedious and fakei found this movie both pretentious and irritating. i've met many people who found this film illuminating... it said absolutely nothing to me.? ~1
Fight Club~2 June 2001~It stinks!~"Boring, quasi-philosophical violence-feast. The plot is dumb, the ""surprise"" twist is not surprising, the dialogue is stiff and lifeless (with lines like ""What you´re feeling is premature enlightenment""). Furthermore, Helena Bonham Carter isreally, truly miscast. How can anyone like this movie? (I know a lot of people do, but I just cannot understand why).? "~1
Fight Club~30 April 2000~Precious and obvious~"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.)""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with."~1
Fight Club~17 August 2002~SLEEPER.~"I am back for my second review of Fight Club. Why, you ask? Because I was told I had an ""inadequate"" amount of evidence to prove my point! So here I go. Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly, nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy soundtrack. I was SO disappointed. ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of life."" Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club. Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group that doesn't serve a purpose. I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent in Planet of the Apes! But in this movie she plays as a rival counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these groups serve for the movie? NOTHING! The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so cool) is fighting ""himself"", is utterly pathetic. How boring. And then the buildings topple... and that's the end. Ho! Wait! I see a naked man from the waist down at the ending! Maybe this is the second reason people liked this stupid, boring movie so much. It shows both female AND male anatomy. How stupid! Repulsive! I DESPISED this movie. Now you know why. If, in fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely: 1. Boring 2. No plot (adds to number 1) 3. Shallow characters 4. Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title 5. Constant swearing/nudity that sickened me 6. Music was cruddy Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity. I was so sick of it before the first half hour was up. I will never watch it again. And I hope my review will help keep you from watching it as well."~2
Fight Club~9 July 2007~The Joys of Sado-Masochism~A man tired of his yuppie condo and dead-end job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it. When that becomes old, they engage in terrorist activities. There is a lame plot twist, which should not surprise most viewers, that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad, culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale. The message of this paean to sado-masochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order to...sell tickets. What is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece, a sad reflection of our society.? ~1
Fight Club~21 February 2013~Pretty Good - But Not Great~"This movie has been hailed by many (mostly men) as the greatest movie of all time. It has been continually rising up the ""Top 250"" and now ranks as the 10th best on IMDb.I'm sorry, after 4 viewings, I still do not get to that level. I don't think I ever will.I have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.It is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.The movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.Jack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.Tyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.The movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes:""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.""If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way,This is not it,andThis is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.""Here is another line that someone shouts:""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.""If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you."~7
Fight Club~14 August 2000~Another Fincher fairy tale~I've heard many people say (and seen many reviews written) that Fight Club is a classic. Mind blowing. Completely fresh. Sorry, but I just don't see it.I'll start with the positives. Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent. Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth. Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity. Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives. The story is just utterly preposterous. Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game. The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem. Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers. Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft. The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need. Everything else is overkill. And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless.Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity. I give it 6 out of 10.~1
Fight Club~2 October 2003~Fight Club and Calvin and Hobbes~"WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW.I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing... but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is: It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen.That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes. Just take a look at the similarities...Fight Club: The Narrator (hereinafter ""Jack"") feels depressed and alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes his friend and companion Hobbes.Fight Club: When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else looks at Tyler, they see Jack.Calvin and Hobbes: When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy.Fight Club: Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this desire in Jack himself.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her. Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same desire himself, if only to himself.Fight Club: Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the job he did as a parent.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly in the ""polls"".Fight Club: While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss, whom he does not like.Calvin and Hobbes: While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like.Fight Club: When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around him things are serene.Calvin and Hobbes: When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and do what they felt was right. Never has there been such a courageous act by filmmakers since the days of Nosferatu, which was another thinly-disguised attempt to bring a beloved character to the screen... Count Chocula."~0
Fight Club~12 March 2001~A big disappointment..~And what a waste of talents. and my time. Yes, the movie does have some fancy camera work. But I consider David Fincher would be more successful to be a TV commercial producer than a movie director. From Seven to Fight Club, I don't see any growth in his filmmaking. Dark and grotesque as usual (or even more) but his movies absolutely has no emotional impact on me, excepts the unpleasant after taste.? ~1
Fight Club~5 February 2000~I Hated This Movie~I ordinarily don't take the time to comment on things of this nature, but this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! Fight Club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience. It was replete with violence, sex, gore, all with no purpose whatsoever. The movie said nothing - it was just film and actors. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity! There was gratuitous sex, violence, and blood and guts. Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, and I don't know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained. This movie is a waste of anyone's time. I highly recommend that you stay as far away from Fight Club as possible!? ~1
Fight Club~5 November 1999~This is garbage~This is the worst piece of trash I've seen in many a long year.I've seen comments that the movie presents the shallowness and hypocrisy of the squares all around us, and offers a way out through the infliction and receipt of pain in bare-knuckled brawling with consenting partners.Sorry, I can't see it that way. All I see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises. There is nothing liberating in this piece of trash. There is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk.Given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this, it's incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made, and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it.If the movie demonstrates anything, it's that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over. The inmates are in charge, and we're all living in a lunatic asylum.~1
Fight Club~3 October 2013~Wretched and Unforgivable~"This is one of the most Unpleasant Films you are likely to see. Making you Squirm is perhaps one of its 'Charms"" and part of what makes it a Teen Favorite.This is an Ugly Thing, both in Tone and the way it Looks. It starts out with a lot of Unsightly Stuff. Like the Victim Self-Help Meetings where we have to look at a Homely Woman, about to Die, looking to ""just get laid one more time before it ends"" and Meat Loaf with Huge Man-Breasts drooping to his waste being hugged by Ed Norton while exchanging Affection and Sweat.That's just the beginning. It gets a lot more Repulsive as things go along their Merry Way. We have the Central Conceit and Title of the Movie, that Place where Lonely Guys meet to Beat and Bond. Then things really get out of hand with a Zombie Squad and a lot of Speechifying about the Evils of Capitalism, Consumerism, and Zen Stuff like ""when you own your possessions they own you"" and other Well Worn Witicisims that might have been Insightful a Thousand Years Ago.If you are a Fan of those Bare Knuckle Cage Matches, Guy Ritchie Movies, Neo-Nazis, or Anarchists Anonymous, this may be Entertaining. But it can also be a Pseudo-Intellectual, Inane, Disturbing Diatribe that is not Cathartic, just a Vile, Witless Waste, Pretending to be an Ultra-Cool, Post-Modern Philosophical Guidepost for the New Millennium.The Film is Objectionable, Hideous, Unsightly, Overrated, Trashy, Dumbed-Down, Unforgivable, and Absolutely Awful. The Stylish, Talented Director can not be Forgiven for this Wildly out of Control Poisonous Picture."~3
Fight Club~23 September 2000~boring, over-rated, pretentious, confused, and very silly.~Although this film was watchable for the first hour or so, it goes very rapidly downhill for the sorry remainder of it's duration. There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while.? ~1
Fight Club~12 February 2008~Maybe Golf Can Fill The Void!!~"It is nice to have all the material accoutrement of a thriving, cosmopolitan guinea pig. You are raptured by consumerism, which includes owning several hundred pounds of Scandinavian furniture.You have a precocious infatuation for a white collar title, and your lackluster, extra curricular activities have dictated that you mollycoddle someone with testicular cancer!! As enticing as all of this sounds, you know what sparks your interest even more, BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE!! (I have been underemployed for over eight years now, I am all ears!!) What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!! Brad Pitt conveys his message to Edward Norton very convincingly, and now, the trick is to spread the good news, but, remember rules one and two, you are not allowed to talk about it, and, you are not allowed to talk about it!! How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality. You have experienced excruciating chemical pain, someone torched your condo because they want to get to know you a little better, you got fired because you always have blood stains on your clothes, you want to blow up a credit card centralized information building complex, and sex has not been this sensational since seventh grade!! Nobody said that this was a family oriented film!! The aggregate depravity for all of the characters in the movie transcends a diversified experimentation with needless destruction, their devotion to the non-conventional is a little too difficult to comprehend!! What does anybody really accomplish by going this route anyway? Capitualation to the bizarre? This movie's charades of insurrection are exhilarating to the clinically demented (Otherwise known as the fight club) The less I know, the better off I will be I think!! Banalities pertinent to the Bourgeousie have brazenly threatened this bevy of belligerent overgrown boys who wish to brandish their high levels of testosterone... So Now!! Life is one big boxing ring!! This is a potpourri of apocalyptic misgivings which are socially perverse!! How do you empathize with any of this?... You don't!! This website has ranked this movie the 31st best film out of the top 250 ever made.... To concur with these findings would be tantamount to indulging the character that Brad Pitt played, to the nth degree!! The psychopathic rumination involved in all of these felonious antics are even more repugnant than the eating habits of an alpaca!!! It is truly indicative of human nature to favor the form of fruition which is pecuniary, their form of fruition deals with societal malcontent and mutilation!! The resonating agitation, which serves as an inspiration to everyone in this movie, is commensurate with the film ""Clockwork Orange""!!! Both films possess a ruthless determination to establish an adamant,counter-culture militancy with a bunch of immature misfits!! The macabre actions to both of these movies signify a heinous non-justification which is pertinent to everything!!! This is not what the phrase ""Change your sedentary lifestyle"" means!!! There are other recreational diversions out there, maybe golf can fill the void!! As far as unprecedented creativity goes ""Fight Club"" gets a resoundingly perfect ten!!! Overall, however, for ""Fight Club"" to be ranked the 31st best movie ever produced, I don't know, I really just do not know about that one at all!!"~10
Fight Club~10 April 2000~One of Norton's best, year too~Chuck Palahniuck's Fight Club is a exciting, stimulating and surprising look at a typical macho porn (coincidence to porn, at the end of the movie, look real close for Brad Pitt's d***). The movie circles around a man (a usual great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way to live is to beat each other senseless. Soon a club starts, and a type of fascist society of fighting men are abound. This film takes many turns, many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even funny. One of the best of the year and Fichner's best since Seven.? ~10
Fight Club~27 May 2002~Jon Monsarrat review: too arty, too violent, mindless & awful~"I won't spoil the plot for you if I say that ""Fight Club"" is about guys who like to fight each other, no holds barred. I'm an action movie buff, so I thought it might be fun and cartoony. I like Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. But I hated this film.The violence is very real and awful. There is a lot of pretentious art crap (such as Brad Pitt appearing for brief flickers of time), and the film is similar to war films whose sole purpose is to show you the horror of war. I've got enough problems without psychological trauma, thank you very much.Plus, the characters are incredibly unbelievable. When you fight someone in real life and do real damage, the human reaction is you go to a hospital, you think ow ow ow ow, and you think I'd better stop fighting. No. These guys eat it up and turn it into a hobby. That's psychopathic.Who should see this film:-- film school types: go crazy, have a blast watching the blood-- action movie types with a strong lack of empathy for suffering. And stay away from my daughter.Sorry, but at least I've stated some intelligent reasons for giving Fight Club a worst-of-the-worst 1 out of 10."~2
Fight Club~18 August 2014~Don't talk about Fight Club~"The first rule of Fight Club is ""Don't talk about Fight Club."" But we're going to break the first rule of Fight Club and talk about Fight Club.Fight Club is possibly one of the last original movies made, before Hollywood started ripping off, reimagining and remaking everything that ever made Tinseltown money.So if for some reason, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, when you get done reading this, go out and rent Fight Club.A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And Fight Club is a good movie. And one that stays with you long after the credits begin rolling.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Brad Pitt (Who I'm not a fan of by the way) is perfectly cast as Tyler Durden (and he seems to be having a very good time here) Helena Bonham Carter can always be relied upon for a good performance, here once again, she is superb. As for Edward Norton, it became apparent the year before this movie, with 'American History X' that he was one talented actor destined for great performances in great roles.His first movie was opposite Richard Gere in Primal Fear in 1996. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting actor which he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for 'Jerry Maguire' He also won a Golden Globe. Not bad for his first time out. He the. Worked with Woody Allen before his second Oscar Nomination for 'American History X' he lost this time to Roberto Benigni for 'Life is Beautiful'. Benigni also beat out Tom Hanks for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Boy did the Academy get that one wrong!But this was to be his last great movie. (As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now.So, what the hell happened?Bottom line, Norton got a reputation for being difficult. Lots of people think of Norton as an absolute control freak. That Norton is not someone you want to work with.Also, Norton isn't shy about airing his opinions to anyone who will listen. If Norton feels like he hasn't gotten the credit he is due, he will shout it from the rooftops. If he isn't happy with the final cut of a movie, he simply promote it. That is frowned on in Hollywood where stars are expected to support their movies no matter what.Brad Pitt (as I've said I'm not a fan) settled for being a famous A List superstar than making good movies I often said outside the Oceans Franchise ensemble, and with the exception of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'The Assassination of Jessie James By The Coward Robert Ford' Pitt has not made a good movie since Seven. But I love his performance here. I don't believe another actor could have played the role of Tyler Durden as well as Pitt.But back to the movie.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience despite the premise of the movie. The studio wanted to market Fight Club to women because of Pitt. But they knew the film's violence would appeal more to men. It was a tricky one. In the end they hired an ad agency. They did a great job of promoting a tricky movie.Go watch Fight Club."~8
Fight Club~10 May 2016~One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script~"Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time."~10
Fight Club~29 June 2012~Fincher's best film along with Se7en~"""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club""I will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously.Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"~10
Fight Club~17 September 1999~First and Second rule of Fight club: Don't talk about Fight Club.~First and Second rule of Fight Club: Don't talk about Fight Club. So I guess I wont. But what I will say is that this movie will blow your mind, and iam not exaggerating. This is one hell of a crazy cinematic experience. Warning! You will never quite view liposuction the same way again.? ~9
Fight Club~31 July 2021~Not that great~Way overrated movie. Cant believe its nr 11 of best movies.? ~2
Fight Club~15 August 2013~#10 in the IMDb top 250.....really?~Having just watched this film, I honestly can't believe it is ranked in the top 250....let alone in the top 10! Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10.~8
Fight Club~28 March 2022~Somewhat memorable~"If I had seen this as a teenager, I might have liked it better. Unfortunately, for an adult, this just felt quite juvenile.There's this type of film that tries so hard to be ""edgy"" and ""cool"" that it comes across as insincere and artificial. It often works on teenagers, as they lack comparison.I kinda feel like complaining about the utter objectification and lack of humanity of the one woman in this film, but then all of the characters were so made up. I'd probably be much angrier about a film like this if it came out today - there are certainly qualities to this that could be actually harmful.If nothing else, Fight Club works as a cultural reference point. Anyone you meet who is a very vocal fan of this film is quite likely to fall into a certain category of person.? "~5
Fight Club~26 December 2004~One of the best films of the decade and also one of the most important~"The first time I saw ""Fight Club"" I despised it. I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including ""The Matrix"" (which is not quite as realistic as ""Fight Club""). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it much.However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's now #41).Well I'm happy to report that I found ""Fight Club"" utterly brilliant on third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver"" - according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name simple and soft).Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator, ""Jack,"" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being ""a laborious dog"" on its initial release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish, and I can understand why some might view ""Fight Club"" as a very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the camera.And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now.Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999. In a year of some really good movies ""Fight Club"" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films.It's easy to see how this might be considered the next ""Taxi Driver"" thirty years from now."~10
Fight Club~22 April 2004~One of the dumbest films ever~Also one of the 10 worst films of all time. Are we sure Ed Wood is dead, because I swear he must have written, cast, and directed this major turkey. If people claim not to understand this film, it's merely because they have an IQ of 3. I even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week! Talk about not having a life! There was a half hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock's series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this. As to the acting, well I couldn't find anyone doing that here, but then Ed Norton is one of the worst actors alive today (as is Pitt), so you shouldn't be surprised there. Meatloaf was the only person even trying, but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year old.? ~1
Fight Club~6 January 2002~What a Load of rubbish~A flop just about everywhere.critics talk as though its a classic.i thought it was the pits.Edward Norton voice drove me mad i hate voiceovers.was there a point to the movie.some weirdos may get some crazy ideas from it.a movie this bad deserves no praise.a case of the emperors new clothes if ever i saw one.? ~1
Fight Club~5 September 2006~Most overrated POS on the top 250~I went to see this with a friend because I'd heard 'it was good' at the local IMAX theater, no less. I went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever. Once I actually saw it, I realized it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some real stinkers. I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.They should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.From me, 1 star.~1
Fight Club~3 June 2006~Unadulterated pretentious trite (spoilers galore)~"...in which pretty much the only aspect that doesn't totally disappoint is the cinematography (basically an elaboration of the set design on ""Seven""). Even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated (some ""brothers"" or someone). Norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch (I haven't totally decided yet), Bonham Carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent (Woody Allen obviously hasn't helped), and Pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with Norton (anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded - the guy just looks good with cropped hair). Other than this we're looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who can't watch it anyway cause it's mostly rated 18. It's the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it. A little rubbish goes a long way these days.Having appreciated both ""The Game"" and especially ""Seven"", I'd like to think Fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it. Let's see what happens next."~2
Fight Club~6 November 1999~Something doesn't quite fit with this movie...~"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started..."~1
Fight Club~7 August 2000~You have got to be kidding me...~"I cannot believe this film is rated so highly. Granted, there is a Hollywood bias in this database, but rarely is such an idiotic film given such accolades! After seeing the poster for this film I had no interest in seeing it. But I watched it on the advice of a trusted friend, and was amazed at how much it was exactly as I had expected originally. A macho guy film on a par with the ""Die Hards"" and ""Lethal Weapons"" of this world. ""Rambo"" too.? "~1
Fight Club~6 June 2004~the poor vicitimized upper-middle-class white man?~Despite the clever crafting of this film, it is basically a complain-fest about the poor upper-class privileged white male blaming all his woes on Ikea. Is this the extent of self-proclaimed victimization that is taking over American culture?Disturbingly to any intellectuals, this movie's amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason -- as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions -- as if the poor young white businessman who's been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores. Is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up? It's even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 9-11 take this film's logic into reality...is the point of this movie to say that American commercial freedom SHOULD be attacked?With all the sexification and glamorizing of violence, and its poor-me ranting against consumer products (rather than taking responsibility for one's own commercialism or participation in it), it's hard to find a redeemable net-sum to this movie.Ed Norton is, as always, terrific. Brad Pitt very good in this role too. And I very much appreciate the filmmaker's talent, but I wish he would use it for something that was thoughtful.~1
Fight Club~2 January 2020~The Story Of Descent Into Madness~A wonderful film. The depth of character structure is close to perfection. It beckons the question, when reality, fantasy, and mental illness collide could any of us withstand the torment within. It is as much horror film as it is dark humor. Brilliantly written and acted, it is a must see for any true cinephile!? ~10
Fight Club~28 May 2002~Good that it tries something different. Bad that it fails.~"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one. This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?""That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good.Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird.And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea).If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least?I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie.Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't.Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shwshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close.1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort."~1
Fight Club~3 March 2021~Just let it sink in and remember the first rule of fight club~This film is a classic and it comes from a disturbed, yet brilliant mind. The acting is flawless, the soundtrack is amazing, there's not one thing wrong with it. I particularly like how it depicts the 1990s, this paradoxical hollow-but-deep quality with a neopunk-like urge, it's edgy, it's nonsensical to an extent, it comes from a very real place. It's everything it's supposed to be and Project Mayhem is a rite of passage that every teenager needs to see as utterly revolutionary at some point. Brilliant.? ~10
Fight Club~6 September 2019~Undoubtedly my favourite movie of all times~When I first saw Fight Club, I was sitting dumbfounded for 10 minutes after it ended and titles went on. This is pure masterpiece. Everything in this movie is perfect and creates a whole ideal picture. THE CAST. I adore and admire Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. The colours, the light. The image and vision of the city that inflames and creates a constant tension. Emotions and mental state of the narrator, feelings and condition he experiences, especially in the beginning scenes - I felt it to the bone. Worth multiple rewatching - you will notice new things and details every time. Final scene brings goosebumps. David Fincher is a genius.? ~10
Fight Club~13 July 2021~STILL THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!~It's been almost 22 years and it is still an amazing movie with an insane ending!! Anyone who has not seen it should definitely give it a try.? ~10
Fight Club~7 May 2010~Stupefying beyond belief; Fight Club is a messy spectacle of ugliness, exposition and crass ideologies playing out under a broad banner of mainstream entertainment.~"I read that Fight Club is a ""man's film"", whatever that means. Truth be told, it's a little boy's film, a messy; scrappy; clawing; pseudo-philosophical piece of turgid nonsense lapped up by people who see a music video aesthetic crossed with their favourite actors churned out of this contemporary Hollywood star system we have that just happens to dabble in some meek philosophy: bums and nobodies like the ones in the film will find its gimmicky pretences enthralling, appealing and quite interesting. For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him. The film's entire thesis is captured in a sequence in which, at the fight club of the title, the store owner comes down into his own shop's basement to question what everyone's doing. After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him. The owner runs off; suddenly attuned to allowing the club to remain and all he needed to arrive at this point is a good fight of some description. That's it; that's all you need to know right there – the rest is nonsense of the highest order.The film plays out under this facade of post-modern trickery and modern movie making gimmicks, thus rendering it ""accessible""; but the fact we're expected to swallow this infantile babble about how difficult it is to be a blank, bummed out nobody; a thug, a vandal, whose lives are in the dank state they are because they never found any particular field in which they could excel, is pathetic. The film was David Fincher's fourth, but he will not churn out a worser piece of cinematic drek in his life than the adolescent, preening nonsense that is Fight Club. The piece is essentially one long flashback and is narrated by Edward Norton's nameless character. When we first see him, he has a gun in his mouth and finds himself in an area chock full of explosives courtesy of Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Norton initially I.D's himself as a slave to consumerism; an unexciting office worker who comes to find solace in fighting and violence with other men in an organised fight ring from whence the title derives.But in Durden, a frightening character is created: a thug, a vandal, a terrorist but a role model; an individual whose manic hair style; cool looking shades; extravagant dress sense; sexual habits and natural charisma paints positive characteristics in an individual that ought to be anything but. Durden sees himself as a saviour; a liberator; an army general whom leads his troops and encourages them to break the shackles of life; someone whom frees and liberates via terror, as exemplified in a scene set in a convenience store car park in which he threatens to execute a young store worker if he doesn't return to education. All this leads to a sickening finale, an end that carries a highly romanticised, emotionally heavy sensibility about it as bombs go off and two people embrace.The film is from the pen of Jim Uhls by way of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film is Palahniuk's inane babbling against the machine; his banal, inane ranting and raving of which the arguments in the film are put across by way of nothing more than childish expositional tidbits on behalf of Pitt's character: ""The things you own end up owning you"" is a sample. In stark comparison to Norton's grey suit; blank shirt-clad and office booth based character, the one he shares most screen time with, Durden is a dangerously vibrant explosion of colour and energy. Later, there's a reason for all this hopping about in characteristics and mannerism as well as the restrictions in the Norton-Pitt interaction; but in itself, opens up a number of problems as to how they can be in separate places at once and how on Earth one person can know about one item (such as the whereabouts of the human fat) with the other seemingly oblivious to all links to it.Make no mistake, the film is the clawing ramblings of someone with some serious issues. In attempting to wage a war on consumerism, we get plenty in the way of product placement for companies such as Pepsi and Apple Macintosh; its approach sees a world initially filtered through the psyche of an insomniac in Norton's character, before support groups and false emotion helps cure that and a character named Marla (Carter) push it back to the forefront again. Is there a need for her character? Marla's presence opens up a sub-plot to do with her own problems of suicidal ideation and a fling she has with Durden which is entirely pointless. After a while, the film realises her presence is futile; that the piece is meant to be about the relationship of its two lead men, their masculinity and their relationship with other men, scrapping her for more inane tangents that run off on separate strands.The whole thing is as empty headed and crass as it sounds, this underground fight ring escalating from a celebration of pain, violence and all things grimy and nasty into a tale of a terrorist group full of 'misunderstood' philistine-infused males. In creating an ugly film about ugly people with ugly views, but filtering it by way of sporadic philosophy and sociology with an accessible aesthetic in its MTV-style appearance, Fincher has crafted a text he's most certainly above. It's nonsense of the worst kind; the sort of nonsense that has an eye on being labelled as something higher than first appears, addressing people in society doing what's deemed menial jobs before actually becoming someone in the ring during which battering and bruising someone else is the answer to life's problems. It's babble; babble of the most patronising and disorganised, sporadic order; a maddening and dulling faux-intellectual piece of nonsense."~4
Fight Club~20 June 2001~Boys who fight!~Big strong handsome boys take their shirts off and sweat and fight eachother! Oh boy! Oh yeah, there's a girl in here too (Helena BonhamCarter) but she kind of acts tough like a guy too. Lots of posing andposturing in this film, it's very 'cool'. I found it hollow and couldcare less. Clockwork Orange said it better and was better acted 40 yearsago. Rent that one instead.? ~1
Fight Club~15 December 2021~This film has aged well~Back in 1999, I was 28 and much too happy with the world to go see a Brad Pitt movie. So I watched it now when I'm 50 and alone. And I was pleased with the experience: As any good film should, it leaves you shaken and stirred. It awakens inside you the same rage that the hero of the story couldn't suppress anymore.Although not an action fan, I didn't find the violence gratuitous or sickening, the nudity excessive, or the special effects gimmicky. The twist at the end is both brilliant and extremely valid; and the final scene prescient and timeless on multiple levels: Slice it any way you like, it is we - the conformists, the office crowd, the middle classes - who are afraid of our own power, and never fail to construct a prison for ourselves.I deducted a star because the final cut should have been edited more vigorously (there's at least 10 - 15 minutes' worth of dead weight in there). And also because the naturally stunning and usually memorable Helena Bonham-Carter is so hung up on looking ugly and sounding American in this vehicle, her otherwise prominent character adds nearly zero depth, nuance or development to the story. Given her role as the narrator's mirror-cum-doppelgänger, she simply fizzles out.~9
Fight Club~29 September 2004~Violent, lame, Bloody, lame~Who needs this movie? I sure don't. Looks like generation X or Y or whatever the hell they are called this week love it. I'll say this, it is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood, ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world I'm different.Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong. What kind of parents do they have is my question.First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not?A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment. I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get therapy, please.I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated an 8 like the score in front reveals. Now I know overall statistics mean absolutely nothing.~3
Fight Club~19 June 2023~I need an 11th star... My personal favourite movie No. 1~Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time, deserving an exceptional 11/10 rating. It stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional storytelling. David Fincher's direction, combined with a stellar cast, delivers an unforgettable experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. From the moment the film starts, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The brilliance of Fight Club lies not only in its captivating plot and visceral action sequences but also in its profound exploration of societal discontent and the human psyche. The enigmatic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are beyond extraordinary, capturing the raw essence of their characters with unparalleled intensity and authenticity. Pitt's Tyler Durden is a charismatic force of nature, while Norton's unnamed narrator is a haunting embodiment of disillusionment and suppressed desires. The chemistry between them is electric, fueling the film's unrelenting energy. The plot itself is a rollercoaster of suspense and unpredictability, leading to a mind-blowing twist that has become legendary in the annals of cinema. This revelation turns the entire narrative on its head, challenging our perceptions and forcing us to question the very nature of identity and reality. Fight Club's bold social commentary on consumerism, masculinity, and rebellion resonates deeply, making it a film that transcends mere entertainment. Fincher's meticulous direction, coupled with its gritty visual style and the iconic narration by Norton, creates an immersive atmosphere that is both dark and visually stunning. The film's impact goes far beyond its release, continuing to influence and inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. Fight Club is a groundbreaking work of art that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance. It is a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic gem, and a testament to the power of storytelling.~10
Fight Club~24 April 2013~Film that you hate to love~I still think that I shouldn't like this film. That I shouldn't allow myself to like this film. Its worldview is so ugly, so nihilistic and corrupted, that you actually fear that your own morals darken just by looking at it. Sure you justify it to yourself by telling that it's actually telling us not to give into hate, not to believe that our lives have no meaning, not to realize that we're just corporate puppets. And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden. The style, the art direction, the camera work, the rest of the cast, the music, the dirty jokes, the plot twists, the sheer ugly charisma. You might never like this film, no matter how often you can force yourself to watch it, but you can never deny that it's not a brilliant piece of film making. And that is why I think everyone should see it at least once. Because it's the end of the spectrum, as of now. You'll appreciate life more after you've realized that this is a work of fiction and that you're not living in it yourself.~10
Fight Club~13 June 2023~Pretty Good Movie~Rating: 7.9 Overall, a Pretty Good to Good movie that was very entertaining to watch the narrator devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of 'Catcher in the Rye' (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying).Very Good Direction, Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Good from Brad Pitt, Decent to Pretty Good from Edward Norton, Pretty Good from Helena Bonham Carter, ), Good Story, Pretty Good Screenplay (Though extremely meta and pretentious; a modern day interpretation of Catcher in the Rye), Decent Score, Good Cinematography, Great to Incredible Editing (Especially how it edits specific frames into the movie to mimic the editing style of 'Tyler' and allude to how the narrator may be having illusions), Very Bad Visual Effects (Looks extremely tacky and reeks of the Late 90s/early 00s style of forced CGI), Good to Very Good Production Design (Shows the dark, dirty world the narrator has gotten himself into), Pacing was good (constant quick pace which was helped by the movie starting at the end); Runtime was good (no need to cut or add any scenes), The build to the climax and epiphany was good with the final 15-20 minutes being executed very well (though I felt that there could have been 5 more minutes added to the end of the movie), The tone and narration of the movie was extremely annoying because it was told through the lens of a pretentious 'Holden Caulfield' who hates the world and leaves it to find himself (therefore being extremely meta in the process of telling the story), The actual twist (while I knew ahead of time) was very easy to spot as there were many plot/logical holes that could only be explained by the twist.~10
Fight Club~21 July 2023~A No Holds Barred...Cult-Classic MASTERPIECE!~"Surrender to FIGHT CLUB!A No-Holds-Barred Knockout!If you haven't seen it...STOP whatever You are doing... And see it!If you HAVE...See it again! In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT... Or shrewdly pretended not to!Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political IN-correctness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film that practically cries out.... ""HATE ME! DESPISE ME!"" O. K...An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities.FIGHT CLUB drop kicks them!Yet, this CLASSIC is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it... And then HATE yourself for it!Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.The term ""Ride"" is employed so freely to movies made in recent years, that it has become rather meaningless!Fight Club re-invents the word!Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to those metaphoric wailings... ""We're still men!"" of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton-Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles........FIGHT CLUB synthesizes both the Adult Males' pent-up frustration and their self-induced reluctance to communicate it, so clearly expressed in RULE #1: ""You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!""YES!... Ladies and Gentlemen, in this life, FIGHT CLUB is, without a doubt, one ""RIDE"" you most simply DO NOT WANT to miss!10*********.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o Español, are MOST WELCOME!"~10
Fight Club~18 September 2020~This is the real meaning of Fight Club. Most people don't know it. Do yourself a favor and read it completely.~"The problem is: most people don't understand the movie but love it anyways, because of the great actors. Just in case you don't like fight movies: it's NOT A FIGHT MOVIE. The main story is about a spiritual awakening caused by a huge amount of mental suffering. The suffering is the result of identifying with the ego, which sooner or later always leads to depression. Identifying with the roles we play in a hypocritic society and identifying with the things we own. These are big mistakes and the protagonist is making all of them. Nobody can help him, because nobody knows the reasons for his suffering, not even the doctor. Then the awakening process starts, it is a self-healing process of the protagonists' psyche: a psychosis. It happens unconsciously, the subconscious mind of the main actor creates a hallucination: a guy, who shows him the root of the problem and what he needs to change in his life in order to solve the problem. And it works out! The last scene shows the heavily injured protagonist saying to Marla, ""I'm okay, I'm really okay, trust me. Everything is gonna be fine."" There are many different, wrong explanations of Fight Club. This is the real explanation and real main story."~10
Fight Club~11 February 2016~Clearly I'm not in the target audience~"It's been a good 15 years since I've seen ""Fight Club"", and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that ""gotcha!"" ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't ""get"" the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake.It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says ""The things you own end up owning you"", it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory. You can taste the smugness.It's not a lot of fun, let's put it that way.4/10"~4
Fight Club~1 April 2000~The greatest cinematic trip i've experienced!~When Fight Club was first released to theaters i was very reluctant to go see it. I heard from many people that it was confusing and that it made no sense. They were so wrong. when you watch this movie you have to go in with an open mind. this movie isn't for the naive you must know how the human mind works to really enjoy the film. i must say that the film was great.I won't waste time telling you the plot because there is so much to it i might give something away but i will comment on the acting. Edward Norton is by far one of my favorite actors. he play just about anyone and he is very good in this film. Brad Pitt is in top form in this film. in fact this is the best thing he's been in since Se7evn. loved his performance. Helen Bonham Carter was also good as the lone female in the movie. very powerful performance.The camera work in this film is magnificent and David Fincher i ggive you much admiration for putting this film together.Fight club is exciting from the begining to the very surprising end. go see it now. 8 out of 10.~10
Fight Club~21 October 2020~A Staple Of Modern Cinema~David Fincher's masterpiece is the best film school you can find out there. It is a milestone of cinema in every aspect. The shot composition, the framing, the editing, pacing, the production design, camera work, everything is top notch and creatively executed. The performances of the complete cast are carrier defining and the characters they are portraying are already legendary in cinema history. It is highly entertaining, rewatchable and just a fun experience throughout its running time. A truly remarkable film which left a huge imprint and influence on cinema.? ~10
Fight Club~8 August 2023~Love the dark and gritty tone~"Edward Norton's performance as the unnamed narrator is a highlight, capturing the character's emotional turmoil and gradual descent into chaos. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler Durden is enigmatic and captivating, embodying both charisma and a darker philosophy.The dynamic between the two characters represents a psychological duality, with Tyler as the embodiment of the narrator's repressed desires and frustrations.""Fight Club"" left a significant impact on popular culture, influencing discussions on masculinity, consumerism, and the quest for meaning in a postmodern world. The film's memorable quotes, such as ""The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club,"" have become part of the cultural lexicon.? "~10

Fight Club~3 April 2009~Its majesty Figh Club~"I've read few 1 star rated comments of FC and I got amazed how people who dislike this movie enjoy trashing and insulting people that find it masterpiece... I didn't like it at all first time I've seen it and if I knew about IMDb then, I'll surely give it 2-3 stars. But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) – all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that ""this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain"" or ""it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity"". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...People can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side... Fight club is wonderful and poignant critics of the world today and 8.8 rating tells me that most of the people got it right. For all the others – too bad for you that you're not able to see it's excellence..."~10
Fight Club~16 September 2008~Sorry, it bored me to tears. And then made me mad with bad storytelling.~"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed onceI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alivebut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as menonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understandincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10"~5
Fight Club~16 July 2007~What about Helena?~A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter's incredible acting performance in this movie. Because it's guys who post for the film she's been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn't looking for redemption. She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and has been ignored on these boards thus far.? ~9
Fight Club~7 March 2022~Not My Cup of Tea, Surprisingly~I popped some popcorn and sat does to watch Fight club. I had high hopes. I mean, it was highly rated and had a good cast. It clearly was not a low budget movie, either. I was patient but surprisingly, Fight Club never clicked with me. I think the problem was, it was just too odd and really, just too dumb. I rated the film a 5. If Fight Club had more humor, or perhaps better humor, it could have gotten a 6, maybe a 7.I think guys between the ages of 17 to about 25 might like the film. Having said that, I do not know if I would recommend it to that demographic. They might end up take a cue from the movie and start punching each other in the parking lot, post movie.? ~5

Fight Club~9 June 2010~Brilliant. Masterpiece. Soap.~Fight Club. What can you say about Fight Club. It's awesome? Not enough. Brilliant? Not there yet. Should've won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay? You're on the right track. Stay with me and I will run you through the whys.Why should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap that came out of Tyler Durden's and the Narrator's mouths. But the philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each character's state of mind.Why should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena Bonham Carter was the only person who could've played Marla Singer. No one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just as well as the rest of the male cast.Why for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film? Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick, cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all time.Best Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt's performance with the key component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn't really give a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.Best Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's twisted novel and twisted it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this movie wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be the same cult classic that a lot of people come to love and worship.If you put all of these element's together, you get Best Picture. A story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.There you have it. Also, kudos on the editing and the music.Fight Club ****out of****.Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Language and Sexuality.~10

Third state baby, this is an ""I am"" state, living in the moment and enjoying the present.In the US in the 1990s, the domestic economy boomed, giving rise to a surge of middle-class consumerism. What is consumerism? Life goals are closely related to the acquisition of goods, even if those goods are not needed for survival or for the traditional purpose of showing off. In consumerism, people are obsessed with the process of acquiring goods as the basis of their identity. The social system also serves for consumerism, such as designers who are specially responsible for enhancing the attractiveness of goods and ubiquitous advertisements, etc. The biggest spiritual shackles of consumerism lies in this. The process of acquiring goods has become the basis of people's identity.Jack is such a consumerist. He worked in order to make money, and to make money in order to buy more and better material, goods became the purpose of Jack. Jack did the same boring work every day, and his boss was bleeding him. Jack is portrayed as a consumer in a society where consumerism is prevalent, and he is caught in the trap of consumerism, in the cycle of work and consumption. He is a prisoner of the spirit, unable to feel his own worth, unable to feel the vitality of life. He began to lose sleep, and he began to look for a way out of his pain.Jack is a submissive camel enslaved by the material and system, while Tyler is a lion who dares to fight against material society, opposes all rules and advocates spiritual freedom. When Jack met Tyler, fight club was born. Fight makes people devote themselves to it and release their wildness. The pain brought by fight makes people feel their own existence, makes people temporarily break away from the cycle of work and consumption, and makes people throw away all the troubles and discomforts of life. This method is popular with many people and more and more people join fight club. Taylor yearns for a world that reverts to a primal time of instinct, and Taylor still becomes an extremist. Taylor wanted to liberate mankind from modern material and institutional civilization, and he did it by destroying it. But this is not desirable. Although we are constrained by the social value system and rules of modern civilization, they also bring us social order and progress. Although the social value system and rules of modern civilization shackle part of our nature and become the shackles of our spirit, they guarantee the higher efficiency of social operation and the guarantee of our high standard of living. So it is not feasible to throw away material and system completely. So the lion evolved into a baby, and Jack killed Taylor. The baby represents a new birth, re-establishing its own worth and will.In the beginning, we are tamed as a camel, taught what values are and told what to do. Then we began to question and reflect, becoming lions of confrontation and destruction. Eventually we become babies, abandoning our old values and rules and perceiving the world all over again, reevaluating everything we come into contact with. Jack eliminated the split personality of Tyler, brought himself to a state of harmony, reached the infant state. Newborn babies have the will to choose actively, no longer blindly pursue the value defined by the external world, feel their inner world, redefine and create their own value, and achieve spiritual freedom."~10
Fight Club~22 October 1999~Not as provocative as it thinks, but still a hit~I was looking forward to this since I'm a fan of David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, and since I read and liked the novel. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end. Not the plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays much better in the movie. Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary. Still, this is almost nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting story, so you're carried along. And all three leads are terrific, as is the supporting cast(including an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto, formerly of MY SO-CALLED LIFE, going blond here).? ~9
Fight Club~10 July 2002~Pass~If director David Fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it. The first problem I have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever. What starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other (mainly due to the always great Edward Norton) slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity. This movie becomes so trashy I had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again. The main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story. The film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in Which Ed Norton punches Brad Pitt in the ear and when Pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies. But besides that this could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. So unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess.~1
Fight Club~30 May 2009~Do Not Go Gently Into This Good Fight~"According to the official studio synopsis, David Fincher's film is described: ""A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Edward Norton) and a slippery soap salesman (Brad Pitt) channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town - until a sensuous and mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) comes between the two men and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion."" Meatloaf again.As you'll discover, the film's official synopsis isn't even remotely correct; but, it's a good way to ""sell"" ""Fight Club"". This film is violent and *pornographic* - this is a WARNING - but, except for Jared Leto's silly putty face make-up, the cast cleans up well. The beatings are brutal, but help make the film's point, and are a part of the protagonist's madness. ""Fight Club"" is a comedy about the lead character's rejection of society's domestication of his life. Or, it could be about something else...To Be a Man.The film received an ""Academy Award"" nomination for the ""Sound Effects"" by Richard Hymns and Ren Klyce (beaten by the first ""Matrix"" and the latest ""Star Wars""). ""Fight Club"" is excellent in many ways, but isn't (and shouldn't be) as polished a ""production"" as 1999's big winner, ""American Beauty"" - a film which opened simultaneously, and presented critics with more palpable male angst. ""Supporting Actress"" Carter deserved some consideration for her memorable ""Marla""; she even sings gets in a few lines from the ""(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls"".********** Fight Club (9/10/99) David Fincher ~ Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf"~10
Fight Club~25 November 2019~If you think this is about fighting you fail to understand its message~Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.~10
Fight Club~4 December 2004~One of a kind movie.~"There never has been a movie like ""Fight Club"" before and there never will be again.""Fight Club"" is a great movie mixture of a great story, acting and style. Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great and one of a kind movie.Director David Fincher's directing works effective. It gives the movie both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and discover some more things on every viewing.Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I probably wouldn't have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role comes too soon after his in ""Twelve Monkeys"", both the movie and his character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the big man-breasts.The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie with street boxing. This is not the case, ""Fight Club"" is a personal movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the anti-society message much like in Kubrick's movies was the case.Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my book.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"~9
Fight Club~12 October 2019~Life-changing masterpiece~I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the cliches but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time On Line and get to the nearest video store!~10
Fight Club~13 July 2022~Every rewatch it gets better and better~This is one of my favorite films, the acting is top tier, I thought the story was captivating and interesting all the way through. Fantastic symbolism, character arcs, camera work, experimental scenes, etc. My one complaint would be that it is a pretty long movie and I usually have to split into 2 watch periods. However, I think it is a good length for the story being told, and would not be the same if it was any shorter. The end scene always gives me goosebumps. Will always recommend to anyone.? ~9
Fight Club~21 January 2019~This is clearly overrated !!!~I understand that the purpose of this film is brilliant but it is made so poorly and most of it was so boring ; the movie is too long , i kept checking my watch throughout the whole movie. I think this would make a better book than a film and I would recommend you to read the book or to read about the story before even watching this film , because it was misleading to the point , and wasn't clear at all.? ~1
Fight Club~19 May 2000~And here I wondered why the rental wasn't rewound ...~"... because one cannot sit through this idiocy till the end! It saddened me to see this film - promising through the first half or so - end up trivializing actual human suffering, in lieu of ""destroying something beautiful."" Heal, don't hurt - there's too much pain in the world to add to it - is that so hard to fathom? Hard to believe this rates so high. 4/? "~4
Fight Club~11 November 2021~A pulsating investigation of broken masculinity~Adapted from the transgressive novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club is a tour-de-force in violence, action, provocation and unreliable narration. Its story is meticulously crafted so that the great reveal, whilst shocking, also makes a great deal of sense. Brad Pitt's iconic performance as the now infamous Tyler Durden is never less than engrossing and the twisted bromance/romance menage-a-trois which provides the film's heart is delightfully unique.Fincher's direction is pulsating, unforgiving and slick. The film broods with intensity but never takes itself too seriously. In fact, its at times off-beat quirkiness somehow enhances the most disturbing scenes. There's a nonchalance to the psychological and physical suffering that takes place in the film which is as well-judged as it is disturbing.This is not a film for all tastes; however, unlike a number of films which came out around a similar time, there is real substance which underpins the film's iconic style. It is a deeply masculine film about the need to feel connected. It's a film which revels in nihilism that is about the need to find some form of meaning. It's a film which seeks to provoke but not idly or immaturely; at its heart, it seeks to stand up for the down-trodden, the neglected, the marginalised, the weak. It wishes to say, whoever you are, however low you have fallen, there is a place for you and your journey may yet remain to be defined. After all, if a character as maladjusted and confused as the unreliable narrator of this film can find some sense of meaning in his life, then there must be hope for all of us yet.~9
Fight Club~7 July 2021~Isolated insomniac dilution~The narrator is depressed isolated lonely and addicted to ikea. He hates his job and life and needs to find a way out.. then he meets tyler durden. A care free witty handsome man who is everything he wants to be. They slowly descend into revolution violence and anarchy. This movie in a lot of ways reminds me of taxi driver and joker. Men who feel like nothing but want to become something. But that something might not be exactly what they wanted. Great movie and great commentary on isolation delusion and how it will drive some crazy.? ~10
Fight Club~27 February 2022~Top 5 worst films i have ever seen~"Starts out promising, but minute by minute this movie becomes trash. Until i almost shut it off but wanted to understand why it got 500k likes on IMdb, therefore i continued this monstrosity. Not only did it make absolutely no sense. I don't think Brad or Ed read the script before agreeing to make this garbage. All i could say is wow this was terrible and embarrassing. I do not believe a person could look another person in the eyes with a straight face and recommend ""Fight Club""? "~1
Fight Club~3 August 2000~A really dumb movie.~`Fight Club' 0*. Anarchy takes a well-trained and organized army. Peace requires using 19th century technology to end 20th century technology, thereby blowing us all back into the 18th century. Of course this all leads to great sex and a cure for demons inside you. And, along the way you can beat the hell out of a bunch testosterone leaden fellow travelers. A really dumb movie. Bad acting and some of the most boring cinematography of 1999. Skip this one.? ~1
Fight Club~9 March 2020~A classic~I would make a review but I don't want to break the first rule! Just watch it...? ~9
Fight Club~2 January 2021~Masterpiece~Soundtrack, visuals, acting, pacing, tension, emotion, intelligent, plot twist, with an important message of anti capitalism. this is the perfect movie.This thriller will have you on the edge of your seat throughout and is all the more thrilling and relevant in today's society, 22 years on!? ~10
Fight Club~6 August 2022~The Ultimate Rule Breaker~Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most unique movies ever made. Its perspective on society is very accurate in its point of view. Even though anyone could say that its philosophy is partialy wrong and I don't think anybody could argue that it is not. The way it ends is also extremly special in the fact that its hard to tell if its the bad guys or the good guys that won. Its hard for us to know if we are supposed to rule or not for a character like Tyler Durden. The final twist is extremely good and its presented in a very unpredicted way. This movie is like somebody with a mental dissorder. Everything is chaotic, brutal, controversial and suddent. Most of these things are in part because of David Fincher's direction. Its direction is simply flawless, there not a single error in the direction! And it might seem like it is fully flawed when you look on its surface but if you look closer you always find out that it has no error! It has so many things you can talk about and so many easter eggs reffering to the ending which makes it extremely rewatchable. The performances are some of the best cinema has ever seen. Its awesomeness in its puressed form!~10
Fight Club~1 August 2021~The problem with Fight Club isn't Fight Club itself.~"My first instinct was to write some witty, over-used joke about the first rule, but then I realised that I actually had a decent chunk of serious things to say about this movie, so here we go. Speaking of the first rule, I just broke it.Fight Club is another one of those films that the so-called filmbros will tear you from limb to limb for not liking. Ever since its release, to say that it's built somewhat of a cult following is an understatement. It's been so ingrained in popular culture that even I've got to admit I made the ""first rule"" joke a couple of times before I had even watched it. And the problem is that ever since then, it's been worshipped as the epitome of filmmaking, the most profound commentary on culture, the greatest movie of all time, etc. Etc...Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Fight Club a lot. I've always been a fan of Fincher's, and this film, stylistically, is a beautifully gritty thriller, the kind that I've come to love. And it certainly deserves a lot of the praise that it gets. I don't think that it's the greatest movie in existence, but I did like watching it a lot. And a lot of the stuff that I'm about to say is going to make it sound like I hate this movie, and I don't. Fight Club is a good movie. However, I think that the biggest problem with this movie isn't the movie itself, but rather, the culture of people who have come to worship this movie like it's some sort of cinematic god. You know, those same people on Letterboxd and Instagram who think Parasite is an obscure foreign film and think that Joker is ""relatable"".And it's honestly kind of annoying that this perfectly great movie had been ruined by this filmbro culture, to the point when someone says it's their favourite movie your first thought is ""oh s**t"". And that's the thing - I have nothing against people who do say Fight Club is their favourite movie, but just because of that small percentage of people who are just... like that, your mind will automatically go RED FLAG even if it completely isn't. And it's almost ironic how this movie has been packaged and adored by the masses, adored for its anti-consumerist culture by the very consumerists that it criticises.I'm realising that this has veered away from being a review and is slowly turning into an essay about how much I hate filmbros, so let me just wrap it up with some final thoughts. I don't hate Fight Club, but I hate the people who have ruined it for people who genuinely like it.-Sasha."~9
Fight Club~1 February 2023~If 'Donnie Darko' is the mystery edition of high school movies, 'Fight Club' is the mystery edition of Lethal Weapon... or something...~"Just what the flippin' heck is this movie?!..The first third is ugly revolting dry nonsense. I almost left the thing, but i pushed through because i've been eyeing this for two decades now, and i wanted to finally have closure over what the hell this might be. One of those movies where the rating is so high, but just looking at the poster i know we just won't be friends.State of the art for 1999 talking CGI penguin that is passable for a hallucination.Big big, biiiiig liberties on how easily people get round up into cult like groups. The passing of time is something the movie handles with great liberty due to the special nature of the main guy, so it could be that...A twist that wants you to rewatch with a ""ahh now i get it attitude"", instead of never watching again with a passion. How successful is it, well, i'd say that might differ from person to person.Culminating in an ad-hoc, might i add, successful (yes), brain surgery with a desert eagle in the end.From about the first third, it is like a constant roller coaster ride of ""all right, that is where you are going movie, i see"", and ""the frick is that now movie"", i'm very perplexed by it, cannot rate."~0
Fight Club~29 July 2018~I am Jack's love for Fight Club~As my movie-buff persona started growing, I decided to find out what movies were everyone's favorites. I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction. Fight Club is one of David Fincher's best films, and it is probably one of my top 5 favorite films of all time.~10
Fight Club~3 January 2020~Crazy and unusual movie~A real brain explosion. Fight Club is the best in its genre. The film shows a sense of deja vu well. Young Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are gorgeous. Unusual script. Amazing and memorable soundtrack.? ~10
Fight Club~10 September 2021~A perfect film...!~I watch this at least once a year... Near perfect in all aspects... Story, direction, character, visuals, soundtrack, humour, action...Just watch and enjoy this now classic piece of movie magic by David Fincher...!? ~10
Fight Club~27 May 2006~Huh?~"I have been attempting to watch IMDb's top-rated movies for some time, and I rented ""Fight Club"" with anticipation. I had breezed over the Palahniuk book and had been intrigued with the subject matter - I was looking forward to seeing how a capable cast and director would turn out the material into a film that was so highly rated here. Would this be a bullseye like ""The Goodfather"" or an overrated episodic fable like ""Shawshank Redemption""?Much like the subject matter, the film hits you right in the face from the beginning. The Narrator is on a quest for understanding. He initially explores this through encounter groups that challenge his ability to express vulnerability and to get in touch with his feelings. His quest remains elusive, and he meets the main female character Marla in the groups. She is also struggling. On a business trip flight, he meets Tyler, a soap salesman. His relationships with Marla and Tyler takes us through the rest of the film.I will not attempt to describe the plot and evolution of the characters - this has been done quite well by others without exposing spoilers. I will say that this movie walks a veritable tightrope in the manner of Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Hung Kam-Bo. The first half of the film is dynamic, with tight crisp direction, cinematography, and dialogue - the characters are fleshed out and you believe them. Unfortunately, it begins to lose its grip about halfway through. The sense of a coherent ideology interweaved with complex character relationships is overwhelmed as director Fincher goes to the well too often with gratuitous violence. While violence is certainly an extension of the ideology here, the overuse of it convolutes the message. There is also a ""surprise"" that alters the viewer's perception, but it is carried out so implausibly and with such obviousness that the framework is further weakened. Near the end of the film, I began to become bored with the proceedings and had to restrain myself from fast-forwarding to the end.Much has been alluded to here about the ending. Strong symbolism is certainly evident and the ending makes for a great recapitulative exclamation point. But, for a movie that is rated by viewers as the #33 greatest movie of all time, it ain't that great - the ending even becomes obvious as the two competing ""characters"" pull out all stops in advance. Movies such as ""Public Enemy"", ""La Bete Humaine"", ""White Heat"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""The Matrix"", and even the passive symbolism of ""Castaway"" made a greater impression on me.I found ""Fight Club"" to 1/2 of a very good film, but this is ultimately unsatisfying. And what about the film's point of masculine evolution? The message of an enlightenment through aggressive clanship in hand with passive isolation has been explored in countless films to much better effect, including ""American Me"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Brassed Off"" (yes!), and particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". The latter film is probably the best exemplification of this idea.Overall, ""Fight Club"" doesn't contain enough to build a true ideology, mythology, or any real lasting impression for me. Its points become too obvious and blatant to give it any more than a 5."~5
Fight Club~18 October 1999~The plot twist kills the film.~"This is the first film I have seen in which the plot twist utterly and completely destroys the film. A good contrast is with ""Sixth Sense;"" the twist makes you look back at the film with even more interest. You may even want to see it again. The plot twist here is so ridiculous, so embarassingly idiotic, that you suddenly feel ashamed to have enjoyed the film up to the point of its revelation. What were they thinking?? "~1
Fight Club~12 February 2006~The film of an entire generation... masterpiece~"If someone has told you that ""you need to see this movie,"" then they're not far off. They're probably in their 20s or 30s and lived through that time when Starbucks was the next big thing, companies were starting to ditch dial-up for DSL, Casual Friday was the only motivation they ever had to live through the week, and their parents were too busy getting divorced to force them to go to graduate school.When it comes to periods within these eras of self-reflection, satire movies like Office Space come to mind. However, Fight Club goes a step beyond and then some, taking a look at how this lifestyle obsession invades every aspect of life, sinking into our personal lives, making it impossible to find a woman who doesn't despise your guts outside of the physical side of your relationship, where being clever and funny are the only things you have to keep yourself sane, and where a generation of MTV-raised, Saturday morning cartoons, post-Reagan politics, Hollywood-worshiping, McDonalds and 7-11 Slushees men are being turned into demasculated raving psychotics trying to find any escape from their misery.Fight Club comes along at a time in history where it's perfect. We have our narrator and his miserable insurance salesman life with a job he hates buying all the useless crap he doesn't need to fill his apartment to satisfy himself with what he thinks makes him perfect and socially acceptable. He becomes so sick of himself that he seeks any escape. He finds hope in support groups for men with testicular cancer and starts to regain his sanity, only to have his hopes shattered when he finds another faker in the group... a woman. Things spiral out of control when he finds a strange soap salesman on a business flight and starts to take great interest in his life. He then leads him to a path to hit rock bottom, to live among the dregs of society, redefine his masculinity and prove it to others. What begins as a weekend hobby soon collapses into a downward spiral of complete and utter destruction and a seemingly hopeless struggle to put the pin back in the grenade.The film contains line after line of brilliant writing and takes twists and turns where you least expect. Every character is acted perfectly and not a frame of film is wasted. Some have claimed this as quite possibly the least predictable movie to ever come out of Hollywood. I would completely agree. However, this is not its only strong suit. Fight Club incorporates elements from almost every genre: drama, horror, thriller, action, suspense, mystery, and romance just to name a few. It tackles so many subjects and has so many messages it's really hard to know what to look at first. This is one of those movies where everyone has a favorite scene and no one has the same favorite quote. A film that speaks for an entire generation of men and the future of our lifestyle obsessed society, Fight Club is an all-time favorite for me and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. Just sit down and watch with an open mind and you will not be disappointed."~10
Fight Club~16 February 2000~What a Waste of Talent~"Quite unfortunate. I respect most of the people in this movie, and they do show some good acting chops in this movie. Unfortunately, it's a pale screenplay directed with no distinction. Ed Norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascist-wannabes with ""American X,"" so what was the point of getting involved in this mess? Norton deserved better, as did Pitt, Bonham-Carter and Leto. Sad - I was hoping for a meditation for modern life and the culture of violence. I guess I'll just have to go back to ""American History X"" and ""Natural Born Killers.""? "~1
Fight Club~28 May 2002~Good that it tries something different. Bad that it fails.~"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one. This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?""That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good.Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird.And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea).If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least?I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie.Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't.Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close.1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort."~1
Fight Club~13 May 2010~Rule number one about Fight Club; you do not talk about Fight Club. Rule number two about Fight Club: you do not talk about Fight Club!~1999 was a great year for film, with many great films releases that year: The Matrix, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense are just a few examples. To join them was Fight Club, a controversial film based on a popular novel and directed by David Fincher, a man whom career was on the up.Edward Norton play an insurance clerk who was suffering from insomnia and struggles to deal with it. He starts by attending support groups for people suffering from long term illnesses to cope with his issues. Yet that disappears when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts to attend these meeting and takes away their edge. Whilst on a business trip the man meets Travis Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and salesman. They quickly becomes friends and move in together into a dilapidated house. They also start to take joy when having fights and the popularity of these fights quickly expand into Fight Club. But under Travis' leadership Fight Club soon takes an even darker turn and it's up to the man to stop him and his plot.Fincher is a very skilled director and with Fight Club he gives audiences his most stylist film. He uses a lot of visual trick and starts to play around a lot more with the camera. He shows confidence with CGI and the nature of how it was used was fitting for the film. There is a dark style and tone throughout, Fincher does not hold back the violence or some of the more grim aspects of the film. There is a lot of dark humour in the film, particularly during the early part of the film. Fincher with a screenplay by Jim Uhls which is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk tell a very complex story and there is a lot of themes throughout. There are themes about people trying to find their identity, how the human mind works, criticisms of modern advertising and consumerism and how people could use it or become hypocrites, how a cult would function and of course, man's desire for violence and destruction. Despite it's title this film does not focus to much on the underground fighting. This is an intelligent film which will allow the audience to think.There is some excellent acting in this film with a great cast. Pitt and Norton were brilliant in the lead roles, with Pitt having a potent charisma throughout whilst Norton is effective as an everyman character of the piece. Bonham Carter was also great in this film and these 3 actors were a dream team together.An excellent film.~9

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~12 August 2010~An Epic in every sense of the word.~"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~15 February 2020~Great~The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.? ~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~28 September 2020~Great movie~Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 March 2003~They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~8 March 2011~My personal favourite of the trilogy~I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~19 December 2002~A standing ovation for all concerned.~"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~My precious...~Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious...~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~2 March 2023~Helm's Deep could be the greatest battle sequence of all time.~As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 December 2004~A True Fantasy Movie~From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 March 2006~Magnificent epic~The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!~"I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~Hail The Heroes!~"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!"~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 September 2023~A magical film.~Frodo and Sam continue with their dangerous journey, desperately trying to reach Mordor to destroy the ring, aided by Gollum, who is still conflicted about helping the hobbits.Where do you even start to unpick and comment on a film such as The Two Towers?Epic in every sense, this brilliant film will entertain and thrill you, astonish and move you. This one had me gripped from start to finish, I love the journey, but it's the ending that makes this film so incredible.The battle scenes are astonishing, some of the visuals even now are jaw dropping, the assembled armies look phenomenal. It is pretty much non stop action, for a long film, your attention will be held.The acting, as good as it gets, McKellen, Mortensen and Hill are all considered tremendous, and rightly so. I have to give credit to the magic of Christopher Lee, his very presence and delivery still give me chills, what an actor.Andy Serkis, off the scale, every single Gollum scene was flawless, the voice and visuals are tremendous, what an interesting and successful realisation.10/10.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 August 2004~Tough to put on film but came out very well~"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers)."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~13 June 2006~The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!~The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~12 December 2005~The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...~"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~6 March 2004~The Greatest of the Three Rings~"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~7 July 2007~FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'~You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.4/4. Wish I'd seen it in theaters.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~10 February 2004~If there was a spotlight for all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy-to-be-one film~I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that)? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 August 2020~MASTERPIECE~I've watched these movies over and over and I always notice something new each time. So much went into these movies. I am so happy they tackled the books this way to be able to do it justice on the big screen. Can never recommend these movies enough. Best ever.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 December 2002~All Times Oscar for Effects!~Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.However, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-)People who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now!It is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~10 October 2003~Convincing?~"There seems to be a lot of convincing going on in The Two Towers...Master Samwise convincing Faramir to let him & Frodo go... Merry & Pippin convincing Treebeard to attack Isengard... The ""angel"" music convincing the audience to FEEL SAD NOW... The ""theme"" music convincing the audience to FEEL VICTORIOUS NOW... Peter Jackson convincing everyone how true he has remained to the spirit of the books...From all that I have read, 98% of viewers adore TTT... and sadly I have ended up in the 2% that did notI loved FOTR, but where that film simply veered off the road of the text, TTT plummets off the side of the road, down a ravine, takes some untraveled dirt back roads before taking some contrived short cut back to the original text in the film's forced last 1/2 hourThough I know adjustments are always made in adaptations, this latest installment has lost the magic & sheer wonder of FOTR... None of the storytelling elements that made the first film so special are used in TTT... Sources of my frustration: * Choppy editing * Lack of fluidity * Is this movie a CGI showcase to sell new programs to perspective movie makers? * Axing central book events in favor of unecessary sub-plots * Lack of geographical reference (anyone who's read the books knows about the maps -- but what about those who have not read them??) * Uneven pacing * Forced emotional manipulation (instead of the authentic emotions that FOTR produced) * Sacrificing the thematic nuances of Tolkien's writing in favor of cinematic cliches to please a modern audienceI make no claims to being a ""purist"" or expert... like I said changes in adaptations are necessary, but man, I half expected stormtroopers to be riding on the wolves of IsengardCan anyone understand what Treebeard is saying?What's with these sudden cockney accents from the orcs - Oi's a-gonna ate yo (Meestah Scroooge/Fawvah Krees-mas --oops wrong movie)Ok - enough, it's done, I said it, it's out in the cosmosI'm praying for ROTKFor the other 98% of you -- please disregard this, you've already been convinced."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 July 2018~Possibly the best Middle Chapter Ever~Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter. While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more.Some characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.Some complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century. The Two Towers is a grand adventure, epic war movie, compelling drama and overall, an amazing movie.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~17 September 2004~A very good, great, fantastic, awesome film!~What a great movie. Through the first movie, we already had the whole story set-up, so in The Two Towers in really pick's up.There is not one thing about this movie that I would change. Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel.This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect. And isn't afraid to use them. The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding.The scene's with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river.The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo.The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time.All in all, this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~1 September 2003~A Shout Out to WETA!!! Truly Awesome!~First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement. As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever. However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short. Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players. We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures. Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's more intimate look at the characters. This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement. WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them. They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.Bottom Line:10/10!!!~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~27 April 2004~The Best of 2002!!!! Another masterpiece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!!!~The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!! You better go see this movie!!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 April 2014~LOTR TTT Review~In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.Picking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.The story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.As before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.The Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...The Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect <> Story: Perfect <> Film: Perfect)~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~If you're a fan, that's not about to change.~"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~13 February 2005~An excellent addition to the series~Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~8 December 2002~The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.~The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~8 November 2003~I'm Glad That I'm Around For This One.....~I don't know Peter Jackson, and I've never been to New Zealand, but after the experience of this film, I don't need to.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS is one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, movies ever made.Jackson wisely does not attempt to duplicate the books--that would be artistic suicide because Tolkien's trilogy is unfilmable. Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity.The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell. J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision. Every character is a prototype.Frodo is the hero on a great quest. Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero. Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth. Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same. Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale. The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed. Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.I am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.Bring on The Return of The King.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~Great One~I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).~9

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 November 2007~Part Two: An Examination of Trust, Intention, and Goodness~The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced  Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent  a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity  Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and  from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 February 2023~The weakest of this trilogy is still excellent~Admittedly, I think The Two Towers is quite easily the weakest movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's cursed to sit as a stopgap between the immensely satisfying and exciting first installment, and the epic and emotional final film. However, when its inherent disadvantage is taken into account, it's pretty incredible that it's as good as it is.And The Two Towers is still very, very good. Everything that was of high quality in the first movie is still on display here, as far as all the technical aspects go. It does also have an amazing final hour, with the Battle of Helm's Deep being one of the best single large-scale battles depicted in recent film history. It's exciting no matter how many times you see it. The Two Towers is also the film that introduces Gollum, and it's impressive how well he holds up as a CGI character over 20 years later.The only way The Two Towers suffers a bit is through its pacing. It expands the scope of the series considerably in a very short amount of time, and it always feel jarring being introduced to so many new characters while also coming to terms with the fact that all the previously established characters are off doing their own thing.It makes The Two Towers feel a little messier and less compelling when compared to the other two movies, but if you watch all the films within a short amount of time, it fits in well with the other movies. Assessed as its own film, it probably has the most flaws, but if judged purely as a stepping stone between film #1 and film #3, it's absolutely a success.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~28 December 2004~Peter Jackson does it again, pure screen magic!~"Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Two Towers"". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!"~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~Better Paced than the first, the battle for Isengard was excellent~We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense.The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing. The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~2 August 2006~A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better~"I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: ""Gollum"" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?"~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 September 2020~Epic Movie~"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~8 September 2020~The perfection continues~I'm going to make the same review for the trilogy of movies because i consider them as one great movie. What can we say about tolkien one of the best writers, luckily they made a great adaptation of the book. The film is impressive, it is perfect and very entertaining, time flies considering that each film lasts more than 3 hours. Great battles, great adventure, great drama, great comedy. YOU MUST WATCH IT.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 October 2007~Middle Earth goes to war~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in ""Return of the King"" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The ""Two Towers"" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 May 2004~"Second installment, great DVD, story a bit muddled, a movie mainly for ""Ring"" fans."~"Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary...""As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. ""I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the ""Ringheads"" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a joy to watch. Just too long and boring in spots."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 October 2005~One of the few sequels that equals the original's quality.~"With the fellowship in splinters, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the corrupting ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, as does Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is as great as its predecessor and successor. Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years. A masterpiece.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 March 2004~My favorite of the trilogy!~The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books.The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***½ out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 August 2003~Compelling~Thank You Peter Jackson. These films are absolutely magical. The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie. I looked at some of those who post to slam this film. One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like. I suppose the irony was lost on that one. I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem. I love this film, but I have only seen it once.So do you see... this is a great movie. Even those who hate it can't look away. Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~11 August 2014~a fantasy masterpiece~One of the scariest movie ever made. A lot action. Great story line. Great acting. Great special effects. Great visual effects. A fantasy masterpiece. See it. C.a.d.a.i.n.s And see more good fantasy movies. The monsters in this movie are some of the scariest movie monsters ever. The Hobbit movie are a little better. But still it is a great movie. All the middle earth movies are great. See all the middle earth movie. They are some of the beast fantasy movie ever. See theses movies they are awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it. This is one of the beast fantasy movie. It is so cool? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~1 September 2003~A Sequel in the Same Level as the Original Movie~This sequel of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made can not be seen as another movie, but the second part of a splendid film. The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is also outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. My vote is ten.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~26 December 2009~Raises the bar~"This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 November 2021~The journey continues.~I decided to only make a review on Return of the king because it's my favourite in the trilogy, but Two towers and Fellowship are masterpieces aswell and alot of people seem to agree with me so im just gonna give it a 10/10 score and like i say in my review on Return of The King, the Lord of the rings trilogy is an unbeatable trio of films.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 August 2020~This is a classic...~...I succeeded watching only now from one end to another.Battles and armies look great, special effects look proper even more than 15 years after, and nice-to-good turn-around events that spice up the whole action.I didn't read the books but it worth watching it, for sure!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 December 2002~Vastly better than the first film - Jackson's Empire Strikes Back!~The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up. Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin. However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden. Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard. Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.The plot sounds plain confusing. And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it. But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well. He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better. On top of this the film's pace is much more even.In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy. Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax. It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first. Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well. All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work. Also the comedy was inserted nicely. Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters. The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur. The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character. However the animation is superb. Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast. He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous. After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others. In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo. I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped. The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick. Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly. Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!? Generally the acting is very good. In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with. Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film. Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch. Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around. Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 October 2003~Unbelievable~This movie is a first rate epic. From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world. From Gollum to Helm's Deep, the special effects are innocent fun and spectular. I think Helm's Deep is unbelievable though. Peter Jackson knows what he's doing. He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real. That's why I think it's unbeliveable. How could this happen? I don't know. But all I care is that at least it's good.The movie will utterly be remembered years from now.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~20 December 2004~The story - and the heightism - continues~In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~14 September 2015~Magnificent second part~The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 December 2020~BEST TRILOGY EVER~In my opinion, this is the second best movie of this amazing trilogy.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~7 April 2012~"""The stories that stay with you"""~"Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty ""wow"" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough – or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~28 November 2020~Amazing movie~This movie is very good.I watched it more than once and very time I feels like I am watching it first time.One of the best films? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 November 2022~I screamed so many times~When Aragorn falls off the cliff, when legolas jumps on the horse, when legolas slides on the shield, shooting arrows, when Gandalf advents with Eomer's army, and so many other times. I cried at many scenes: when Sam tells that he fights for something good left in the world, when Haldir's army arrives right before the war, honoring the alliance, and when Haldir dies in Aragorn's arm. I laughed at any scene with Gimli in it (He's such a joy in this whole series) and with Ents being so slow. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' makes you feel so many emotions.Of course, the movie quality is just perfection: story, camera, setting, acting, and everything else. Especially, longs shots of nature and wilderness is majestic and brings the whole story to its root: Middle-Earth. War sequences overwhelm me every single time. However, the strongest advantage of this movie is that it invites viewers into their journey. I am in other place at other time fighting the war with hobbits, elves, wizards, men, and dwarves. Portraying the war in this movie is fantastic technically, but making me feel like I AM a part of this war is just perfection.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~27 February 2005~Life enhancing~"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 September 2022~Relationship Building~"The Two Towers is a great movie. Is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? I personally don't think so. I found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). Though not as strong as Fellowship or RoTK, this movie is full of spectacular moments.The Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. From the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. Though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.On top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Sméagol, Aragorn and Éowyn, and beyond. The relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.When I want to watch incredible action and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.Best Character: Gimli Best Moment: The Battle of Helm's Deep (the entire thing) Best Quote: ""Toss me."" - Gimli."~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 December 2022~With strong world building, emotional gravitas, and excellent action, The Two Towers is another good example of a well done sequel~(Merry Christmas, everybody!)Taking place where The Fellowship of the Ring left off, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor together to destroy the One Ring before making an alliance with Gollum later on. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the orcs who took Merry and Pippin while also making an alliance with the Riders of Rohan. Later on, they would make plans to escort the people to Helm's Deep were they will fight against them.The story in this movie is not only a very faithful adaptation like the last film, but it's also effective in it's emotional gravitas and world building. That way, it helps you learn the situation the broken Fellowship are into and their plans to fight back against the Orcs. Plus the themes of family and overcoming their prejudices are well executed. Howard Shore continues to make haunting beautiful music that enchanted the action and atmosphere of Middle Earth.The production design and costumes are as beautiful as ever, the direction and editing are very sharp, and the action choreography is superb especially in Helm's Deep. And then there's the strong acting from everyone involved.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin go great together as did Andy Serkis as Gollum (in his solid motion capture). Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, Ian Mckellon, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan also did great. Other actors like Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Bernard Hill did very superb job.Overall, The Two Towers is a great continuation of the cinematic trilogy and still holds up after 20 years.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~14 January 2005~"""a good-looking creation albeit not much else"""~The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.~4
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~12 February 2005~A visual masterpiece and better than the first~"So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.When we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking ""tree herder"" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.These three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.The pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.Still, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****"~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 January 2003~As good as the first~"Actually, it's better than the first!First off, see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" or you won't be able to make heads or tails out of this. It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides. There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson. The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen. I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance. His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored. The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film. A definite must-see. I can't wait for ""Return of the King""!? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~22 January 2023~'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' Will Take Your Breath Away~"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a cinematic masterpiece that surpasses all expectations. The film, directed by Peter Jackson, continues the epic journey of Frodo, Sam, and their companions as they fight to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron. The acting is top-notch, with Viggo Mortensen delivering a powerful performance as Aragorn, while Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are heart-wrenching as Frodo and Sam respectively. The special effects are truly stunning, with the battle scenes being particularly breathtaking. The film also manages to deepen and expand on the characters and themes introduced in the first installment, making for a more emotionally resonant and satisfying experience. Overall, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a must-watch for fans of the genre and for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~7 October 2020~The Best of the Trilogy~This part of the trilogy has the lot and as good as the other 2 parts are...Two Towers just delivers delivers delivers. Just a quick note this review relates to the extended addition which is (as they all are) the superior version of the film.There is drama, action, romance, humour, mystery, fun, delight and...The Battle of Helms Deep.This is a magnificent piece of film that is wrapped up within the Two Towers....its like finding bonus bacon inside a cheeseburger.Mmmm cheeseburger!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 January 2021~Epic~Literary no words. Perfection. Bravo to the cast and crew. The battle of helms deep was amazing. Amazing performances , cgi, and score? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 March 2023~The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - A Riveting Middle Chapter That Raises the Stakes~The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a stunning middle chapter in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy, bringing to life the second book in J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy series with breathtaking visuals and heart-stopping action. The film picks up where its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, with the Fellowship broken and scattered and the forces of darkness closing in on Middle-earth.As the film unfolds, we follow the separate journeys of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) as they make their way towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, and of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they try to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from the clutches of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the orc army.The film is a masterclass in world-building and visual storytelling, with Jackson and his team of talented artists and designers bringing to life the breathtaking landscapes of Middle-earth and the terrifying armies of orcs and uruk-hai. The film's action sequences are thrilling and intense, with standout moments including the epic Battle of Helm's Deep and the tense confrontation between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog.But what really sets The Two Towers apart is its exploration of themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the power of friendship. As the characters face impossible odds and grapple with their own doubts and fears, their bonds with one another are tested and strengthened, creating emotional moments that are both heart-wrenching and uplifting.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a riveting and unforgettable chapter in one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. With its stunning visuals, thrilling action, and powerful themes, it raises the stakes and sets the stage for an epic conclusion in The Return of the King.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~29 August 2003~Pretty darned good but...~...not as good as Fellowship. Loved Smeagol - more expressive than most of the human actors in the film. But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?Also, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.But, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps. I expected Huey Lewis and the News to kick in.That aside, I will watch the DVD over and over but I'm hoping the extended version, as with Fellowship of the Ring, will iron out the pacing problems and give us more character study to balance the action.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~10 August 2005~Good but not the best~"Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. ""Impossible"", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt,"" admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~29 August 2003~Good - but far from perfect.~"Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film. It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production. That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows. Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into. You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.Anyway. CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right. Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer. I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime. CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?). Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done. However, the artists could have done with actually ""looking"" at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film. Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&Dragons this isn't much to brag about. However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable. Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly ""Dragonlance Chronicles"" (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.It's an 8. But only because I have an odd taste in movies admittedly, which would put Spaceballs as a 10. I apologise in advance for this travesty of judgement."~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 November 2002~Surprising premiere...worth the waiting!~"Who could ever imagine that the audience in Indonesia would be the first to watch The Two Towers? No one, including me. I have no idea why, maybe by mistake, maybe on purpose, it played this weekend on screen in one theater in Bandung, Indonesia. Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than ""fellowship of the ring"" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~14 January 2023~Re-watched and re-reviewed~To be quite honest I did not believe I could watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy twice, not that I don't like it. On the contrary it's one of the films that strike me the most. Only problem is that each episode runtime is well over 3 hours and that stretches over 4 hours if you count the TV commercials in, which means an enjoyable movie has become a huge commitment as well as a physical challenge. However, given I was in New Zealand a couple of months ago for a second time and Hobbiton and Wetashop were part of that journey, I have been inspired to watch this show again and re-review it.LOTR - what an all-age, all-gender and all-culture silver screen sensation for its generation! From storyline to metaphor, costume to makeup, background to scenery, sound to music, cast to crew, cinematography to acting, there's not a single box it doesn't tick.Storyline has rugged layers (often interpreted as conflicts) which movies rely on. A journey to Mount Mordor is fraught with dangers, perils and treachery. All these are amplified by each and single character's struggle and pain, which are finally overcome by love, trust, courage, determination, friendship and companionship.Seasoned and accomplished actors have undoubtedly demonstrated those traits. Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving and many others have all played an exceptional role in living their characters, so much so that the strong cast in LOTR trilogy has made its The Hobbit trilogy sequel a lackluster.Costume and makeup are well toned in that they fit perfectly with the characters. Women's dresses, men's armors, cookware and even the cute lembas bread all resemble those in ancient Roman Empire times. The acoustics of its sound and music and the grandeur in fighting scenes are simply breathtaking, striking a remarkable resemblance to Troy (2004), making it literally a legendary ancient war movie.As usual I would like to touch on the metaphor of each movie simply because good films should always do more than just describing the story. They need to convey the underlying message. Human's greed and craving for power is demonstrated throughout, not just by the evil spirit but also by those with a good heart. After all we live in a real world full of deceit and temptations. Yet it is those characters like courage, determination, caring and compassion that see us through. A lot of people say Samwise Gamgee is the unsung hero and I totally agree with that. His unfailing loyalty and faithfulness to his friend Frodo Baggins unchallenged bring a tear or two to his audiences. He just has an adorable chubby face I want to pinch - in a fond way of course.Once again I must mention the filming locations that inspired me to re-watch and re-review this show. I want to give special thanks to Hobbiton Movie Set Tours for showing me the cute Hobbit village. The Hobbit houses, the hills, the trees, the grasses, the bridge, and the water mill are all fondly reflected in the movie. That is probably one of the reasons for traveling the world to stamp those filming locations. One goof I must point out though - in the closing scene when Samwise Gamgee walks back to his house with his family, the actor actually bends down over the door frame because the hobbit houses are quite low while the actors are in real size...~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~16 March 2006~It's the middle child of the movie.~This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~19 December 2002~As good as the first.~This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great. It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time. This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters. The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best. The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story. I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf. Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would. Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1. I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3. I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite. It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~4 March 2016~Still Incredible~"The second film did not loose any steam... instead it keeps building. No matter how many times I see these movies I still get the same thrills that I did at first viewing.This film is a bit dirtier, grittier than the first film... due to the war torn areas and great battles involved. CGI used for a lot of these scenes but not misused.. which is nice. I'm kinda picky about CGI and Peter Jackson's films are always done in good taste - never abused.Like the first film, the 2nd film leaves you craving more - which we get in the 3rd in the series ""Return of the King"". I can say that for movies that are around 3 hours in length - the films seems short to me... the time goes by so quickly when watching.Another film I would highly recommend for fans of High Fantasy.10/10"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 February 2004~What Was I Waiting For?~Took me a LONG time to see this film. Anything that EVERYONE liked, I was sure I wouldn't. But, when I finally got around to watching it I was shocked. It was a lovely film and was much more moving than I expected. The effects were great but never distracting as many films are. And the story was faithful. The stars were all perfectly cast and it wsa beautifully adapted. If MGM and the old studios were still making great costume epics today they would have been proud to have made this one!? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 December 2006~Freeking amazing Movie, review from a movie pro~"The people who vote against this movie or didn't see it, or just hate it for hatred. This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with ""political"" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~6 November 2004~The worst of what is ultimately the best trilogy of all time~This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~10 September 2022~Number two with two (towers)~Peter Jackson and his mission - well not his mission, but the mission of our Fellowship (well you get the picture and no pun intended). This is part two and it holds up pretty well to say the least. The movie has the New Zealand landscapes and tries to put as much of the book into the movie as possible.I never read the books, I did try to read the Hobbit before the movies came out ... which I failed to do - but the movies are really well done. Yes Peter got money, but the work he did for it ... not sure if he has health issues because of all the planning and work he had to do for the Tolkien universe he created ... but he did a really good job to say the least.This begins where the first movie left off - and the group will have more adventures, but also has to go different paths - to cover more ground (no pun intended), but also have different stories and people to meet. In the extended edition I watched (actually rewatched because I had seen the theatrical and the longer cut back in the day), you can see even more stuff - and new characters ... well new in the sense that in some cases you get a character that otherwise only pops up in the third movie. But the whole thing makes more sense that way.If you listen to the old commentaries (which are fun and plenty), they do talk about DVDs - if you are baffled: they are discs that look like Blu Rays or 4K discs ... but had way less capacity on them ... also a weaker overall image and sound. But while that part may not have aged well - the movie itself has aged well - it really looks good to say the least. And if you are into Fantasy movies ... well the only thing that remains to be answered: you want to read the books first if you haven't or dive into this? Of course then there is also the new Prime show - which I will dive into sometime in the future.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~4 February 2020~My favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy~The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~16 November 2021~At dawn, look to the East.~Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, whilst Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go to Rohan.This is the very cinematic middle part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.From the opening flyover shots of the snowy mountain peaks, 'The Two Towers' is fantastic to look at and full of perilous adventure.As with the first movie, if you have read the book, it will likely influence your enjoyment as it puts a lot more focus on the non-Hobbit characters and turns the source material into a Hollywoodised action adventure. The script moves the established characters along their journey, introduces more characters and stages some very spectacular events. To do this it splits into a number of directions as it follows different groups through various paths and obstacles. Some scenes put the foundations in place for what is to come in the next movie, whilst most of it leads towards the centre piece of this movie, the Battle of Helms Deep. This unfolds at a relatively uneven pace, but all scenes are technically well made.If you compare the battle to the various spectacles of the modern era such as those in Game of Thrones it feels pretty standard, but at the time of its release it was groundbreaking in terms of the scale of the set-piece and use of CGI. A huge theme in the trilogy is hope in the face of despair and the battle portrays it with some wonderful sequences. The arrival of the elves, King Theoden riding out to meet the Orcs, and THAT moment when sun rises still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.Is there too much CGI? Yes, I think there is. As epic as it makes the battle look, it is distracting when you know most of those vast Orcs legions were generated by computer programmers. That being said, a major success of the movie is it's CGI depiction of the character Gollum by the animators and the work of performance-capture star Andy Serkis. This character is central to the depiction of how the ring corrupts the souls of those who possess or seek to possess it and his scenes are some of the best in the trilogy.Generally the visuals are phenomenally good. The cinematography, lighting, colours, editing, locations, set design, costuming, makeup, props, and general art design are some of the most iconic in movie history. For me the visual spectacle is so powerful it actually detracts my attention from the characters, who are good, but sometimes feel they have come along for the ride.It is a movie that could have been perfect if the characters were better and there were performances that (aside from Serkis) were truly iconic.Saying that there are lots of solid performances, with the best for me being Bernard Hill, Brad Douriff, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and David Wenham. Nobody feels less than adequate for the role. However, I get the feeling that the focus was so much on the animation and the general look and feel that Peter Jackson might have been satisfied with not capturing that many truly memorable character moments.For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 October 2013~A New Power Is Rising. Its Victory Is At Helm.~Every film consists of three acts; The first is where you introduce your story & its characters. The second is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends to bring your entire tale to its conclusion. Almost everyone has a definite idea of how to begin & end their stories but the middle act is always the most difficult. Because no matter how great the other two acts are, if this part isn't handled well, then the overall experience ultimately amount to nothing in the end.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga & just like the novel, it has no definite beginning or ending. What's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple story lines & all need to work. And the good news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel as faithfully as its predecessor did, it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that improves upon the original.Picking the story right from where it was left off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three story lines. The first concerns Frodo & Sam who, on their journey to Mordor, find their peril deepen for there is another who hunts the ring. The second deals with Merry & Pippin, who were taken as hostages in the last film. And the third covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, along with an unexpected ally, head to Rohan to warn them of an impending war. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad- dûr, fortress of the dark lord, Sauron, & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but director Peter Jackson manages to do it once again & what's even more admirable is that he gives equal importance & value to all three story lines as the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers & the decision to conclude it at a different event from the novel sets a perfect stage for the finale. Also, it is extremely well written & narrated for enough time is given to develop its new characters, without ever interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress with its meticulously detailed sets & is ideally fused with the gorgeously photographed landscapes of New Zealand. Camera-work is at its absolute best during the action sequences, Make-up, Costume Design & Sound retain their qualities and Editing trims it down to 179 minutes but just like the last time, I recommend the extended edition for it adds 45 minutes of new footages which further enriches its overall experience.Weta Digital's VFX team made history with The Fellowship of the Ring but the enhancements it brings in The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely CGI & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Howard Shore's magnificent score continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure & is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers adds even more strength to its ensemble cast as the reprising actors once again chips in with faithful performances while the new ones instantly make their mark felt. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum/Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & jaw-dropping performance that it's easily the finest acting of the saga, so far.On an overall scale, The Two Towers is a smooth continuation & a worthy expansion of the world that was brought alive in The Fellowship of the Ring. There are a few artistic license taken but it all stays within the realms of Tolkien's world & remains true to its spirits. Succeeding as another spellbinding & engrossing masterpiece that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering epic, The Two Towers is an immensely satisfying sequel that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor & signs off by setting an even higher bar for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium. One hundred percent recommended.~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~3 April 2023~The Wooded Claw...~The quest to melt the ring in Doom continues, as two Hobbits and a Gollum lacking sinews, crossing marshes full of dread, towards the Black Gate's where they head, and then they're captured by the brother, of one once dear (although he was somewhat affected by the ring before expiring). After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle.? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~31 March 2016~Gloriously epic~"This is the continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).This film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. In fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize Tolkien, an English writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't English or don't speak English as their mother tongue. Suddenly, not only everyone spoke of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation.Epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization. In fact, make an epic film in the old fashioned way, with hundreds of participants, large and elaborate scenarios etc. it's extremely expensive, more than resorting to the modern digital techniques."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 March 2013~Epic~There is one word that can describe 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' : incredible. The best epic movie of all times. The stories blend in with each other, forming the scenery of Middle earth in war. The characters, tempted by the power of the ring, straggle between the good and the bad. The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning. Great performances, in addition, give the movie the excellence.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~19 December 2002~Epic scenes save Towers~"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""Why am I here with these actors?"" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 December 2018~Robbed at Oscars~So it begins. Is there anyone who doesn't love LOTR??? Gimli is the best I mean that jump to the bridge and his competition with Legolas gets me every time. The story and dialogues are very smart like in the first one and I think Andy Serkis deserved an award for that performance I mean it is one of the most iconic performances ever. How did Chicago win Oscar vs Pianist and Lotr???? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 December 2022~The lesser in the trilogy~As I already said in the review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of their reputation and the many reviews for them here. I finally saw them last summer and I loved them all, yet this (the second) didn't win me over like the others. I don't say it's bad, just not on the same level of the previous or THE RETURN OF THE KING.Needless to say that this chapter follows three stories: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin) continue their journey towards Mordor for destroying the only ring with the company of its original owner Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies) and then Gandalf (Ian McKellen) go to rescue Rohan that is ready for the battle against Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Merry and Peregrine (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) plan an attack on Isengard while in the custody of Treebeard.The sets are great, and you can see that they spent all their money for having them so big. The soundtrack is nice, no surprise here. The performances were good, nothing to rave about, and Gollum was very funny despite a bit scary (and I won't recommend this movie to very young or sensible viewers for this reason alone). The problems were that the pace was slow in the second half and made the performances stilted, and the battle scene with those ancient elephants seemed a bit too long for my taste.Still, not the greatest in the trilogy but I think the director did it on purpose for making us wait what was in store for the third chapter.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 December 2002~excellent adaptation~"In regards to the previous of those people who hated the film, this is NOT a literal adaptation of the story. It's an adaptation which concentrates on character development, continues to show a masterful command of the medium with its stunning photography, brisk editing, and quite wonderful special effects. It's NOT a real tale, but based on real human qualities and flaws. By the way, ""The Godfather"" is good, but it's not REAL, either. By the way, movies are supposed to entertain and teach us a few things, and some of us should try a little harder to do just that. If you like the book better, that's your option. Some of us like to keep open minds and enjoy things for what they are.? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~28 September 2016~impressive sequel~The fellowship has scattered. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, on their journey to Mordor, encounter a vile creature named Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are chasing the kidnappers of Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin manage to escape and befriend tree shepherd Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encounter Gandalf reborn as Gandalf the White. They go to Rohan to find King Théoden under the control of evil Saruman.The story and the characters get split up into basically three groups. That back and forth can scatter the tension a little bit. It's a small drawback. I would consider doing Frodo and Samwise in the first half leaving the others to the second half. That would keep continuity flowing. The CGI is world class and nothing is more impressive than Gollum. The movie is able to keep the story compelling in all aspects.? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~7 September 2007~Smashing Second Film~Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 August 2021~Battle scenes will knock your socks off!~The awesomeness of the Battle of Helms Deep, plus the real introduction of Gollum/Smeagol (my favorite character in the series) makes this better than the first in my opinion.? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~27 January 2003~Impressive looking~This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 January 2005~Enjoyable~After the first movie i was looking forward to this one, not having read the books, i didn't know what was coming next.All the characters were there again, even Gandalf, who i thought was dead (ahh, but this time he's Gandalf the white) the visuals were as good as expected and some of the cinematography blew my mind.For me though, Golem stole the show, a very compelling computer generated character like nothing I've seen before. Well done to the special effects crew. The story developed with some interesting revelations along the way and all in all I was satisfied with another chapter of the trilogy.8/? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~6 September 2014~Amazing~The Lord of the Rings does not fail to impress. I loved it all. I don't have as much to say for this one as the last one, because it's a continuation of the same story, but I will try. The acting, once again, was phenomenal. The comic relief, even though it appears in the midst of serious dilemmas, is still really funny, and well done. The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it. I can't wait to watch the final movie of this trilogy, but I'm also shocked at the fact that it's four hours long! It's really impressive how a single trilogy can be eleven whole hours long.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~20 November 2003~Is it possible for a sequel to be better then the first one that was also a great movie?!~Yes! No one has done this since the Terminator films or Godfather. I couldn't believe my eyes watching this film. For the past two years my father and I went to the theater twice to see these films. And the Two Towers was amazing. My father and I have tickets to the next Lord of The Rings ready to go!Like I said of the first one, this was so awesome to watch on the big screen. It's amazing. Even if you don't like the movie, you will love Gollum! Trust me! I can't wait for the third Lord of the Rings! Frodo is almost there!The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers10/? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~19 April 2003~I will give them spectacle and they will love me for it~"I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself.Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of ""Spartacus"" and ""Ran"". Do computers make this any better? Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say ""yes, they do"". The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like ""Fellowship"" did. Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time.Oh well, watch this if you have time for it. I'll go back to ""Empire"" instead.Overall: !!! out of !!!!! time-wasting viewings."~6
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~5 July 2022~Timeless movie!~Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~12 March 2004~Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy~Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~I rally wanted to love this movie.~I really really wanted to love this movie. I loved Fellowship, I found it nearly flawless. I give a 10/10 for the acting and the special effects. If I have never read the books, I would have been absolutely flawed by this movie. Some of the changes detracted from this movie, but not terribly.But the fundemental changed made to Faramire (compare him in the book to the movie - not merely changed but the opposite) seriously undermined the whole plot of the trilogy.Still, I have this an 8/10. On its own merits, it is excellent. But changes were made that weakened the story for no good reason...? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~22 May 2005~The middle~The Two Towers continues almost straight from where Fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are going towards Mordor, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).I was amazed by the special effects of the Fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in The Two Towers. I was gravely mistaken. In the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in The Fellowship, Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast.Small skirmishes of the Fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in The Two Towers, when orc army of Saruman attacks towards Rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king Theoden (Bernard Hill), who is mislead by his councillor Wormtongue (chilling Brad Dourif), while his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth.Theatrical version of The Two Towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. All this was fixed beautifully in the Extended Edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. I personally enjoyed all of the extended and added Ent sequences. Also EE introduces us one new character, Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir (David Fenham) and Boromir (Sean Bean).The battle of Helms Deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. Fall of Isengard, home of Saruman, is shown as Tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat.Peter Jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the Warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like Elves coming to help defend Helms Deep. Some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either.Overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. It all just shows, that The Two towers is just a middle part of a longer story.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 August 2020~The lord of the rings: The two towers~It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~30 July 2020~A terrific follow up to the first film~Out of all of the LOTR films, this one is definitely the weakest but it still holds up as an amazing continuation from where the first film left off.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the story with Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mordor with the aid of Gollum whilst the rest of the Fellowship go up against Saruman and his army.The Two Towers really steps it up from The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of scale. Once again, this film looks absolutely stunning. Peter Jackson's direction is terrific. So many gorgeous shots conveying the beauty of Middle-earth and constantly reminding you how epic it is. I view The Two Towers as more of a build up film. It sets a lot of things in motion for the events that will take place in the third film. Due to that, the film does feel slower than the first but not a single minute feels wasted. It is three hours long but Jackson manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout it with the characters and scale of the world.A lovely addition to this film is Gollum, who we got a glimpse of in the first film. The motion capture work on Gollum is really well done and Andy Serkis's performance helps the viewer feel connected to him. By far the best part of The Two Towers is the ending. The battle at the end is simply breathtaking. It's shot beautifully and the sheer scope of it all makes it one of the best battles in film history. Hats off to the special effects team. They worked extremely hard and it all paid off in the end.The performances are great all around. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson and the rest of the cast from the previous film all did well. The new additions like Bernard Hill and Brad Douris played their roles exceptionally well and contributed a lot to this film.I like The Fellowship of the Ring better but The Two Towers continued the LOTR story brilliantly. Peter Jackson did complete justice here and delivered to us one of the best battle sequences to ever exist.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~22 August 2022~Overall : The Two Towers stands out as one of the greatest sequels of all time with its incredible battle and palpable suspense.~Each of the Lord of the Rings movies is a masterpiece: the cast, costumes, sets, effects, storytelling, scale, directing, and cinematography are all the best of the best. Picking one above the others can be difficult, but The Two Towers rises to the top because of its final battle. The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen. LOTR: The Two Towers edges out the rest of the trilogy by avoiding the weight of beginning or ending a greater story and can be present in the intensity of its own journey.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~2 November 2003~Redeemer~"I got bored in the theater watching the first movie in this trilogy, ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" to the point where I didn't bother to see ""Twin Towers"" until it came out on DVD. Boy, was I glad I did. I was so moved by the characters in the second installment -- especially that hero(!) Gandolph. And I was so moved by the battle scenes that I actually cried. Great flick! The trilogy definitely redeemed itself with the ""Twin Towers.""? "~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~1 July 2020~Pure Art,Its the epic Masterpiece Sequel!~Literally the war at climax was goosebumps it was beyond epic!the music,the visuals and whole production scale was Pure Art the engaging factor back and forth between 3 or 4 different adventures of Fellowships characters it was amazing,the build-up for war and the Gandalf return was incredible,the whole ending is literally piece of Art the fights with CGI monsters and the Dragon's ring quest and tree's attacks it was literally brilliant and satisfying end,Overall its a greatest sequel its remarkably incredible and Pure art its a Masterpiece!? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 January 2014~A strong second act~"Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Dead Alive"" did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's ""By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)"" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a ""10""). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade."~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~23 July 2019~The middle of the story.~Helm's deep is one of the most exciting moments in film history.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~27 January 2020~More action-packed than the previous movie...~"First of all, I must say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was significantly more easy to sit through than ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", as this movie had more action, and wasn't as slow-paced with as much storytelling and setting the mood as the first movie did.Needless to say that you need to watch the first movie prior to watching this 2002 sequel, unless you want to be missing out on a great deal of information about the characters and the storyline.As a direct continuation of the previous movie ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was a nice upscale in pace, and I must admit that I was enjoying this a lot more than the previous movie.While ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is driven by a solid story and character development, much like the first movie, then ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" adds a much needed element of action and fantasy battles.It shouldn't be necessary to say that you are in for a grand adventure when you sit down to watch ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", especially if you are a fan of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre, which I happen to be.And it was marvelous to have the original cast return to perform their roles again, making for a wonderful continuation of the storyline, and not having to adjust to a new face on an already established character.Definitely well worth taking the time to sit down and watch the extended version. Just keep about 4 hours free for it. I am rating ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" a well-deserving seven out of ten stars."~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~2 July 2022~Just as strong as the first~Fantastic sequel. Filming all of the movies at once really makes a difference. The pacing is great, the characters, and the action as well. The Battle of Helm's Deep is arguably the best battle in all 3 movies. And the monologue from Sam... beautiful.No complaints from me.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~20 July 2018~outstanding.epic~This movie is epic.so much love from this movie,so much lessons towards life.loved each character of the trilogy.best place where movie has made.so much vibes,i just can't express in my words.their good acts,their love,their sincerity,theri honesty i am just huge fan of LOTR.one of the best thing is this film's soundtracks......OMG i just can't stop myself to listen all these themes of LOTR .i forget al my sorrow and all my pain whenever i listen these themes of LOTR.one of the best holywood film ever made.so much adventure .i saw it i thing in 2013 or in 2014's middle. then i became the best fan of this trilogy.i love it so much .i just want to live with hobbits.they have no any sorrow,they are happy all the time.honest with each other,being happy,havin fun.i just love it.this movie is my life.whenever i feel tired or bored from my life i just see some scene from LOTR or listen it's theme iand i again gain hope from it.it just motivates me .long live LOrd ot the rings.this trilogy is my life.i'm listening also the theme of LOTR and type this review.though,i just love it so much.each and every character.imagination is bigh thing.whenever i listenthe theme i just imagine myself towards hobbit's place's,being with theme.good thoughts come in my mind whenever i see this film.lots of love.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~15 September 2003~Just as spectacular as the first installment of the Trilogy.~"I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" movies and thought the ""Star Trek"" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing. But after watching ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.This film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved. Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created. The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.The battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.Gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.Like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways. At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like ""Snow White.""These films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have. ""The Return of the King"" should be awesome."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~31 March 2020~Awesome~Wait a minute, is this the first one or the second one??? What ever? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 June 2019~Excellent~It will no doubt be a timeless classic that people will watch for generations to come! It is action packed, fantasy filled and thoroughly exciting. A must see for any fantasy fan.? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~19 December 2002~I could go on watching forever...~"This second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. It ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer Christopher Lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: ""What? Is it over already???""I watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night I was not one little bit tired. All I wanted was the movie to continue right now - but I guess we'll have to wait another year...Compared to ""The Fellowship"", this movie has fewer epic moments (as Boromirs death, the Hobbits being hunted by the Nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. The shifting between the three different storylines (Rohan (Aragorn), Rohan (Merry/Pippin) and Mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. This way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. Certainly, the story in Mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but Jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in Rohan.As for Gollum: I would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! The facial impressions of Gollum were tremendous, at first I really was appalled about how ugly he was, but Jackson really captured the essence of Gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. An Oscar for Gollum? It's an opportunity!Many of the other characters were developed further like Aragorn, Sam or Gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: Not too much, but certainly right on the mark!The only thing I cannot really fathom right now is the way the Arwen character goes, how Eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the Rohan storyline ended right after the Helms Deep battle instead of in Isengard.Oh yes: And the attack on Helms Deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the Rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste.Not to mention the reality check when Aragorn and Gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of Orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am I to criticize :-) ?"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~21 August 2011~The middle one~IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~12 October 2003~Disappointing~As a fan of LOTR before it came out in paperback and of the first film, I was disappointed in the sequel. Tolkien gets lost in all the mugging for the camera, uglified folks, and computer-battle scenes. It is sort of the antithesis of Tolkien, who presented hobbits as admirable for their simplicity and courage. The wrong aspects of seventeen- year-old boys are being appealed to here.? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~aesthetically grim~This is a worthy sequel as I enjoyed myself as much as with part 1. I still haven't read any of the books, but I have to say that the story and plot twists develop in a way I could never have imagined. Some of it was even reminiscent of 'Throne of Blood' (Kurosawa, 1957) which was of course a brilliant adaptation of MacBeth. See that film to figure out which parts I mean plz.The art direction is of course still great as they shot the movie together with part 1 and 3. Here the CGI has become fingerlicking good: Gollum puts Jar Jar Binks AND Yoda to shame!Let's wait for part 3 to drop some concluding remarks about this trilogy. For now it feels great to experience the premieres of these movies and be a part of the hype as well, I might add. The videogame should be Everquest I guess (never played it though). WingNut rules (and Orlando Bloom can surf!): as far as I'm concerned this gets the same rating as part 1.? ~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 January 2004~The Lord of the Rings: The Boring Snorefest~While Fellowship was an excellent mix of drama and fantasy, as well as fantastic action sequences, this LOTR film falls flat on its face. Most of the film is spent on boring talk of how the group is dealing with the situation with Sauromon(or whatever the guy Christopher Lee played's name is), and the film apparently doesn't remember that it's bad@$$ characters can also swing one nasty sword and lay a beatdown on those stupid Orcs until near the end of the picture. According to my aunt, the book had tons of action sequences. Either: A., she got the title of the book mixed up with another one, or B., Two Towers the movie was changed A LOT from the book. Either way, after this atrocity, I am swearing off the LOTR films, and will in no way see Return of the King, even if the reviews dub it the best picture of the century.? ~1
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~4 May 2019~A good buildup movie, but not better than the first.~I enjoyed this movie because it was leading to the finale of the trilogy and the visual effects blew my mind and GOD THE MUSIC SCORE OF THIS MOVIE! I did enjoy the film, but the story didn't blow my mind like the first movie did and I find that a little sad. Not to say it didn't had a good story, it does, it's just not better than The Fellowship of the Rings. Other than that, it's a lovable movie :)? ~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 December 2002~I'm tired. And I'm not alone.~"This is it.""The Two Towers"" has just opened. One can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. At the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all I can say is, let it be...I have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Like that much loved film, I do not judge ""The Two Towers"" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. I look upon it as a further unveiling of Peter Jackson's LOTR mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. But that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as I'm not a believer in ""taste-dictatorship"".Notice I stated Peter Jackson's and not Tolkien's LOTR. With all due respect for JRR Tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), I think that LOTR should by now be just as much a labour of love for Jackson as it once was for Tolkien. Judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what Jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right.Dissenters of LOTR movies, we know who you are. In an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. But in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. For good or evil, I have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. I will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments TTT will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead.I have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. That I love the LORD OF THE RINGS movies, is but a given. That I am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. A choice which I pray I will have the strength to honour. Consider that my leap of faith.In conclusion, the story is far from over. Like Gandalf's famous last words in TTT (the movie), ""The battle for Helm's Deep may be over, but the battle for Middle Earth has just begun..."" Till then, I shall breathe, while I wait for ""The Return of the King""...peace and out."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~14 April 2021~Two Towers~Not a lot to say here. Second part of a masterful trilogy of movies. Amazing story, acting, action, etc. Blew everyone away whenever Gollum entered the scene. Probably saw it six times in the theater.? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~9 January 2011~The Two hours too much (DVD)~"In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as ""Star Wars V"" or ""BTTF 2"" and it's as dull as ""Star Trek 3"". Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!"~4
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 December 2002~This is a Great One!~"I've already written one review, but I'm going to write another one after reading some of the nitpicky reviews.It seems that some people are DEEPLY OFFENDED when a film actually makes money, is wildly popular, a box-office hit, and artistically superb.I've read the books and seen both ""Ring"" movies. FELLOWSHIP was good but doesn't compare to THE TWO TOWERS. The second film in this trilogy is a masterpiece.Peter Jackson has captured the essence and the spirit of Tolkien even if some details have been omitted. How in heaven's name could he have put in EVERY detail. The movie would have been seven hours long!One reviewer on this site actually said he didn't like the smile on a kid's face in the caves.The Middle Earth atmosphere, trueness of the characters, the magnificent battles, the spiritual imagery in every scene overwhelmed and humbled me at the same time.This is the best movie ever made. J.R.R. Tolkien would have been proud.I am grateful that so many have the opportunity to see and experience this fine film."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~4 February 2021~Slower paced with much less action and a lot more talk.~When watching the Lord of the Rings films, one has to keep in mind they were filmed simultaneously. Therefore the good cinematography and groundbreaking visuals are consistent. The same applies to the good performances.'The Two Towers' is my least favorite of the LOTR films for a number of reasons. Firstly, they deviate too much from the original premise. The attention shifts away from Frodo on his quest, and he is absent for large parts of the film. A lot of new characters are introduced, and I felt the cast became somewhat cluttered. With so many new characters and story lines, I found myself easily losing track of the story. One of the new characters is Treebeard - a boring, uninteresting character. Yup, talking and walking trees abound!! (*insert WTF here*!!).The film revolves mainly around the kingdom of Rohan, under threat from Saruman. But what does this have to do with everything? Why is Rohan so important? They loose focus on the matter at hand; that being Frodo on his mission to Mordor. At least the attack scene on Helm's Deep in Rohan was exciting!The black riders are also back, although only for a short while. They no longer ride horses; they now ride on giant birds that look like Pterodactyls - or are they dragons?? Who knows? Unfortunately, as a result, they are no longer creepy. The film's highlight - by far! - was the Gollum, Smeagol. He is an entirely CGI character, yet unbelievably realistic. And he steals the show!! He is the most interesting character with his split personality, and devious grin.'The Two Towers' is significantly slower paced than 'Fellowship of the Ring' and not all that interesting either. There are way too many back stories and characters that the film really has no need for. Unlike 'Fellowship of the Rings', 'The Two Towers' feels like a 3-hour movie.~6
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~13 September 2003~Can't wait for extended verion!~I want to really thank Peter Jacksson and all the actors for sharing their talents so heartfully. Peter Jacksson has really put aside all qlichees and easy going fooly and created a movie true to the books and the author him self. I think Mr. Tolkien is smiling to see what they have created together. Actually I also want to thank the sponsors for not making a commercial stunt of the movies, like e g the first Bat Man movie. There is also no feeling of intefearing with the movie or even the casting of the characters. No playing it safe, just tying to make the books come alive. I have seen first two movies and so far top-notch, I hope to see the extended version of the Two Towers soon :-)? ~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~17 May 2003~Am I the only person who hated this film?~"I was greatly anticipating viewing this film after all the hype and enjoying the first one at the cinema. Unfortunatley I thought this was the biggest load of nonsense I had ever seen. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to get interesting ... and then the film finished. Gollum was rubbish, the scene when he was talking to himself was so bad I had to laugh out loud. Why did the Ork/Human hybrids have bad Cockney accents "" I'm haangry, meats back on the menu"" ??? and what was that tree all about. Am i the only person who gets bored by constant close ups and continued Aragon, son of Bagagon, King of Caragon, Ruler of Daragon etc... type dialogue.It made The Phantom Menace look like Seven Samurai? "~1
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 February 2003~As good as the first one!~"And that's saying a LOT, seeing as how I rated that a 10+/10. And I normally have little interest in the whole ""Sword & Sorcery"" genre, so my high praise means even more than usual. They were wise to film all three LOTR movies at the same time, for it means the 2nd follows the style of the first seamlessly. These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed. It's a shame this (like its predecessor) will probably be snubbed for Best Picture Oscar because it's obvious to anyone other than a complete dullard that these are landmark films whose appeal will long outlast the other Oscar contenders10+/10"~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~22 September 2020~Great movie~"I think this is really better than ""lord of rings:the fellowships of ring"" stricktly suggest to watch this movie... I like it.😍? "~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~27 December 2014~something worth fighting for~"Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~3 August 2003~One of the best fantasy films of all time~Jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic. The performances are on, with Rhys-Davies and Bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film. The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning. But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others: Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be. It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature.Never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~24 December 2015~9 - Excellent~Some see it as the lesser entry of the trilogy. I see it as the vital bridge which allows the characters to develop. Samwise and Frodo spend more time with each other. Gollum gets significant character development as his dual personality leaves the two main characters split on whether he is helping them or not, weakening their loyalty to each other.Merry and Pippin, with the help of Treebeard, get to where they need to go in a subplot that adds humor and character to an otherwise rough movie. Saruman and the surviving Gandalf are also in conflict. And there's plenty of meaty battles. The Two Towers combines immersive setting, intense action and strong storytelling together in an overall essential experience for fans of fantasy..? ~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~14 December 2002~"Spectacular, Surpasses ""Fellowship"""~"My wife and I saw this film at a Carleton College benefit in Minneapolis December 13 (one of the executive producers, Barrie Osborne, graduated from Carleton in 1966). We saw ""Fellowship"" at a similar fundraising event last year. Like ""Fellowship"" the attention to detail on this film was exquisite and the whole affair was masterfully produced and directed. I was never a big fan of the books, but I would say that ""The Two Towers"" was in every way a better film than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". When the battle of Helm's Deep began, I was certain that the film would end there; and that we would end up with a ""cliff-hanger"" ending, and a film that was only a come-on for the next installment. But ""The Two Towers"" was, on its own, complete and satisfying. The Battle of Helm's Deep was an astonishing cinematic achievement all by itself; and that is only 1/3 of the movie. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one. If you loved the first one, get some friends to go with you so they can carry you out of the theater. You'll have the time of your life. This is grand, epic filmmaking. This is why they invented movies.? "~0
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~7 May 2016~Jackson tries to do too much here~I must admit that I did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. Sadly I didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons...Firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. If it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap.The film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. It doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? I got the feeling that Jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths.The second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of Gollum - for some reason I felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. Whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while.I was also disappointed that Gandalf and Saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. Although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story I found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often.The final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - Bernard Hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when McKellen and Lee weren't on screen. John Rhys Davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film.The Two Towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but I just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film.~5
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~11 December 2003~Extended DVD version is excellent and better~"This is a review of the extended DVD version.I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release. Note, that this version has more than just new scenes. Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way. The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow. Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original. Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn). It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.So, just like with the ""Fellowship"" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning. I already plan on only getting the extended version of ""King"" next year."~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~15 March 2023~Epic Journey (EXTENDED)~I recently watched the extended version of Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers and despite some moments where the pace seemed to drag on, I have to admit that the film itself is incredibly entertaining. The depth and complexity of the story, combined with the stunning visuals and epic action sequences, make it a truly engrossing viewing experience.One of the things that impressed me most about the film was the attention to detail in the world-building. From the intricacies of the different cultures and languages to the intricate designs of the weapons and armor, every aspect of Middle-earth feels fully realized and immersive. The use of practical effects and CGI is seamless, creating a visual feast for the eyes.Overall, I loved the film - the whole trilogy is a feast for the eyes. The dialogue, character developments are top tier.~8
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~9 November 2009~The Middle of The Ring~"""The Fellowship has broken, but the quest to destroy the 'One Ring' continues. Frodo and Sam must entrust their lives to Gollum if they are to find their way to Mordor. As Saruman's army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people and creatures from Middle-earth, prepare for battle. 'The War of the Ring' has begun,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, the film was ""Nominated for six 'Academy Awards' including 'Best Picture'.""""The Two Towers"" begins with a reprise of one of the first film's worthiest recreations of Tolkien text, beloved Gandalf falling to his apparent death; then, the film outdoes its predecessor again, and again, and again. The scene-stealing creature ""Gollum"" (superbly voiced by Andy Serkis) is an especially well-realized highlight. It was this chapter being so successfully received that insured ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy could be considered a classic.This installment is as well-produced as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (the three films were shot together); but, with story, pacing, and characterizations much more suited to epic cinema. Peter Jackson's direction is most outstanding, the use of Howard Shore's music is much improved, and Michael Horton is a welcome addition to the editing team. Even the alterations of J.R.R. Tolkien's original work are satisfactory; sometimes, we all must meddle in the affairs of wizards.********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis"~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~18 October 2005~walking and more walking~This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was.? ~2
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 November 2003~Gripping, Spellbinding, Enthralling, Mesmerizing ...~"Oh man, where's a thesaurus when you need one!If you hadn't noticed, I absolutely LOVED this movie! Violence, greed, power, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography of a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.The first movie was a bit ""too busy"" for my taste. I prefer to inhale every now and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous fight scenes, there was enough pause to blink.The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because you got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters bickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing a five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more human.Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter. I don't think I could survive the 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready for it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area for the final chapter. If it's half as good as Two Towers, I won't be disappointed.Gee ... I guess I should go read the books now!"~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~20 September 2003~RELAX! This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book.~Everyone who read the books over and over will most likely hate these movies. Because they do not 100% follow them nor your imagination. It is impossible for them to. This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book. In all honesty if you never read the books and enjoy epics like Braveheart you will love these films.I grew up playing Dungeon and Dragons for fun and have played many RPG PC games. No movie to date comes closer to what these experiences are then these Epic Movies. I mean people complain about LOTR? Have you people seen the crap Dungeons and Dragons movie?There is a point where you can over analyize something. The LOTR book readers have done just that. I'm not one to read books over and over but I can enjoy a movie again if I am watching it with someone new or it has been along time. You guys need to Relax. This movie is beautifully shot and casted well. Peter Jackson is not known for anything but these movies and he will be known forever for these. The backdrop of New Zealand is perfect for middlearth. LOTR is scored by music that engulfes you into the scenes. But what makes these movies so great is the story by Tolkien but adapted by Jackson. It works Period.I'm sure you guys are mad that page 56 of book 2 has a character pausing for breath when they forgot to show it in the movie! Oh the horror. Get over it move on you have your books read them enjoy them. I judged this movie based on it being a MOVIE. I don't even want to read the books after hearing the comments made by their fans. You guys need to ask yourself is this movie REALLY that bad? Or do movies like Excaliber and Conan do it better? I think not. Yes it is not perfect but damn is it good.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~25 August 2004~Like all great classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films~I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general.Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics. I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion. (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions. You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films. The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books. There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions. Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once. All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks. Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses. The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings. This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment. Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights. Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you. The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep. You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~13 November 2003~Superb~In order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours long, tie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall plot, is no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers believe Jackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard to have some studio fund one movie that would require cots. Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers. I guess that is what is making alot of reviewers really angry - the Two Towers has gotten a very high score on IMDB. There's a great reason -the movie is excellent.~10
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~3 January 2003~Can we have some humour please~Well, here we go again with the second part. Hopefully the creators make as much money as they have expected, because that's what it's all about here.Most figures in computer games act better than the people in this film. The effects are also to be found in computer games and even better made there. There are in fact a little more humour in this part (in the first one there was almost none of it) and that comes from John Rhys-Davies who tries to make something artistic of his dwarf behind the beard.We don't see that much of the four boys or what they are supposed to be. This is far from Tolkien's intentions and one wonders indeed why grown-up people are that interested. If you are 11 years old or younger you might be entertained, but most people aren't.? ~4
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~6 January 2003~Almost as great~The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was a great film. Far superior to those dull films about a galaxy far away. Expectations were high for the second film in the trilogy and The Two Towers (TTT) almost made it. Perhaps the battle at Helm's Deep went on a touch too long and uncanonical scenes like Aragorn being lost were unneccessary but these are only minor flaws in an engrossing three hours. There was much to praise.Part of the success of TTT depends upon the Gollum as he is now a key character in the story and as other people have said, you forget that the character is a CGI. It is extraordinary. The interplay between Gollum and Frodo and Sam is brilliant, not just physically but emotionally. If Gollum had been another JarJar Binks it would have been disastrous but he is a real character, at war with himself.The acting varies from mock-epic to perfect. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's pain so tangible that you feel every difficult step in his journey. Sean Astin's speech near the end about finding good in the world made my eyes moist. Viggo Mortensen is better in TTT than FOTR. Liv Tyler looks the part. Bernard Hill is Theoden come to life. And Miranda Otto is my kind of shield maiden.The production values are wonderful as ever and if it is eye candy it is of the superior kind. Well done Peter Jackson and team. My only real complaint is that we have to wait another dratted year for the third part.~9
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~20 February 2022~Just Not For Me~Having never read the books nor watched the movies before today, I cannot say this was a great experience for me. I see the cinematrophical value, the interest for fans of the lore, but as someone agnostic it felt like a very long movie with the story staying always a bit vague. Who are the forces present, why are they fighting, nothing is completely clear if you haven't read the book...? ~7
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers~17 December 2002~Most powerful movie ever, almost a masterpiece~Powerful, irresistible, leaves you stunned at the end, can you wait 1 more year. I'd pay 1000$ right now to see Return of the king...The movie will not let you breathe, which is good and bad. The extended version will allow for more quiet moments and will make this a masterpiece.? ~10
Inception~22 December 2020~Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?~You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen. I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.? ~10
Inception~9 August 2021~Inception was only less shocking to me than the Matrix~When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter.? ~10
Inception~2 March 2023~Answering all the questions with one answer: I feel guilt. ⭐~"When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it's twist. I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. ""Why he is keeping her in his dreams?"" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great."~10
Inception~15 November 2021~Generation defining.~The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking.? ~10
Inception~4 June 2021~My number one favorite movie~Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!? ~10
Inception~1 February 2021~Wait~Wait, did i just watch this or is it just a dream?? ~8
Inception~15 July 2010~Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.~"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"~8
Inception~31 March 2023~Mindcraft...~There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They've been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.Imaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies.? ~9
Inception~9 July 2010~Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!~I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!~10
Inception~13 July 2010~Nolan at his most intelligent best.~Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.~10
Inception~31 July 2010~Come Back Again!~If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.? ~10
Inception~26 July 2010~A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date~Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them.The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity.Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/~9
Inception~12 July 2010~Nolan's first true masterpiece~Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus.I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will.I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com~10
Inception~11 January 2011~Inception? More Like Insipid~"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-"~5
Inception~20 October 2013~"Thick and Unnecessarily ""Complicated"""~"Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide. But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done, too much has been Said and not enough has been Done. Vastly Overrated."~4
Inception~21 July 2010~Dream invasion is the focus of a strange and ambiguous film...~I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.~6
Inception~13 July 2010~Inception is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, a work of sheer brilliance that astounds on intelligence, spectacle and heart~"""The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water."" -Sigmund FreudChristopher Nolan's ""Inception"" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan's masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn't easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in ""Inception"", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach ""Inception"". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person's mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms ""extraction"", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival's (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father's business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb's slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you're in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan's world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan's vision, Wally Pfister's expansive photography and Lee Smith's fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb's troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We're kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan's reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb's unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."~10
Inception~2 August 2010~Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards~"The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several ""levels"" at once, I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too ""ordinary"" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable ""baddie"" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that ""was the real level actually a dream"" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going ""or was it?"" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to ""come in"" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of ""oh look its x"" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't – pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film."~0
Inception~15 January 2011~So much less intelligent than it seems~Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.~4
Inception~23 November 2021~Intellectual masterpiece~Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed.~9
Inception~12 July 2010~Amazing Directing, Captivating Plot, Overall Great~I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.~10
Inception~31 January 2021~Masterpiece~An amazing science fiction movie... Christopher Nolan's another masterpiece... Need a sharp mind to understand the story & enjoy this movie.? ~10
Inception~24 December 2022~A complex, hypnotic, incredible thriller.~Inception is a first class, mind blowing, complex action thriller, it boats outstanding special effects, an A list cast, and some insanely clever concepts.It was love at first sight, I adored this film when I first saw it, and over a decade on, it's still as good. For me it's up there with The Matrix, it truly is that good.It's one of those films that improves with subsequent viewings, as there is always something new to pick up, some detail that you may have missed the previous time.This film packs some big punches, it dazzles in every avenue, one of the biggest features, the visuals, those special effects look remarkable still. The scenes of the streets folding over, just an incredible moment, surreal.Another incredible feature, the acting, Cain, Cotillard, Murphy, Hardy all fantastic, as for Leonardo DiCaprio, I still regard it as one of his best ever performances, he's phenomenal, he commands your attention.Have you ever dreamed you're dreaming?? What a thing to contemplate.Personally, this film is in my top 10.10/10.~10
Inception~29 November 2017~Not as complicated as it seems~Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant.~4
Inception~1 February 2021~Requires Concentration~An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.? ~9
Inception~24 July 2010~Perception~"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

Inception~15 July 2010~A Nutshell Review: Inception~Action aside, there will be some who will liken this to the Wachowski Brothers' Matrix, given its similarities in combining science fiction with philosophical existentialism issues, with cutting-edge action seemingly beyond its time. Nolan goes one up however, with this attempt as he, like Neo, goes beyond the computerized world of the Matrix, where it's still a construct led by binary ones and zeroes, good and evil battling it out under black and white rules. Rules that one cannot escape from since they are what binds our universe together. Here Nolan goes into that untapped power of the mind, the dream worlds that we create in our subconscious, where the dreamer has everything in his subtle control, where anything goes as far as the imagination dare venture beyond physical limitations and rules.This allowed for such a film to be created from a simple idea with a bank heist premise having its skill-based assembled team break into unsuspecting victims to steal ideas locked away in the mind. Nolan loves to tease and test the audience, not lulling us into complacency, with Inception beginning in the thick of the action with tremendous questions being asked as we try and digest the multitude of information thrown at us, with the whys and the what ifs answered in due course, needing to pay attention to subtle details, ideas and concepts to make the film work.We follow Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his lieutenant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as information hackers and social engineers of the new age, offering their services as the black and white ops type either to teach corporate honchos how to defend against like-minded and skilled peers, or to be engaged by these same industrialists to steal information from the competition. With the promise of being able to return to the USA without being arrested at immigration, Cobb accepts the challenge posed by the Japanese Saito (Ken Watanabe), to assemble an A-Team to plant a seed of thought and an idea, known as an inception, into his business enemy Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy). It's an almost impossible task, but the promise to see his kids again makes Cobb recruit the likes of Ariadne the architect (Ellen Page), Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), and Eames (Tom Hardy) the thief.Like the layers that the characters navigate through, the film is equally layered with engaging subplots that expand the depth and breadth of the characters involved, the largest one involving the mystery behind the disappearance of Cobb's wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who now lives only in Cobb's subconscious, and always find a way to thwart his grand plans, making Cobb more of a liability with this unspoken handicap that gets worse as the challenges facing the team grows. The story unfolds like a planning of that perennial big bank heist job, with conflicts between members, the building of skills and the meticulous planning all coming together with so many external variables, that seeks to test the skills of every member to the extreme. And that's what makes the film so terribly engaging, while dealing with emotions and romance, obsession and selfishness, which if I may jest, seem to reflect a side of modern day relationships where sometimes one can get tired and need to seek an exit from constantly being with someone else, 24 hours a day, with nobody around.DiCaprio with his name sprawled over the poster above the other cast, delivers that pitch perfect flawed lead character that Nolan has a knack to create, and brought to life by DiCaprio's performance, having the actor showcase a wide range of emotions as a man desperate to hold onto what he deems dear, with hidden secrets so jealously guarded, living and repeating his pain through the constant re-visits to his memory, breaking all rules of the game as told to his protégé Ariadne. Ellen Page holds her own against the seasoned thespian in two scenes which is bound to generate some gasps for the special effects generated as she picks up the necessary skills for the job, in what would be a Neo-like discovery of how seductive a limitless world could be.I can't rave enough of how Nolan got to elicit wonderful performances from his cast of stars, where little nuances can mean so much, without even saying a word. A flick of the eyebrow, a glance at someone, paint that picture to tell a thousand words. Better yet, Nolan's own ability to hold your attention with his storytelling ability and delivering no less than four stunningly created realms all happening simultaneously, each with another as a constraint or a condition to kickstart a chain of events. You're always left guessing whether the team can accomplish their mission, and there's always that constant threat of danger that seeks to derail everything they thought of in their combined state of comatose, What George Lucas does with those simultaneous theatres of war in the finale of each of his Star Wars films, Nolan does it better with just this one, as he puts that grip around you as we flit from one stage to another. There's absolutely nothing quite like the experience of having seen something great, and want to savour it all over again soon.Inception is best experienced on the big screen, and Christopher Nolan has done the ultimate in performing just what the characters of Inception had set out to do, sowing the seed of a premise and concept that holds so much promise, then delivering that promise with aplomb, so much so that you'll want to continue living in that world created by the cognitive senses interpreting what's on screen, then fantasizing on it a lot more with the subconscious. Inception is definitely one of the best this year, if not THE best film of 2010 thus far. Don't miss this film!~10
Inception~18 November 2010~Intellectual or Unintelligible?~Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks – and ordinary punters – have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clichéd if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time. So much for polls.www.scottishreview.net~6
Inception~29 May 2023~An HONEST review~"Inception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end. As a viewer, I was enthralled by its intricate plot. The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable.Visually, Inception is a feast for the eyes. Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies; it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns. Some may find its complexity overwhelming.Inception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Does it qualify as what is known as a ""masterpiece?"" Yes. However, SOMETHING, just something, held me back from a 10/10 rating. I'm not quite sure what, but there's just something small missing to get it to that perfect rating.In conclusion, would I watch it a second time? Yes. Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time? Yes."~9
Inception~6 February 2021~Exceptional~Inception is good, very good, amazingly good. Music: phenomenal. Story: Exceptional. Acting: Great. Cinematography & Special Effects: Fantastic. Overall this is a great movie, although complicated needing a second watch on my end to fully understand everything, this is a must watch for anyone.? ~0
Inception~24 January 2011~"""You're infecting my mind!"""~"Alright folks, I saw the same movie you saw. My wife and I both went into this with great expectations. Visually, the movie was interesting. Beyond that, it was ho-hum for us. I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point. The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather. This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix. I feel like I got something more similar to ""The Happening"".? "~5
Inception~13 July 2010~More than just an aMAZEing movie~"Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say ""Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that."". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with ""Avatar"". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first ""Matrix"", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like ""Kindergarden Cop"". No disrespect to ""The Matrix"" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in ""Memento"", and you certainly see it in action with ""The Prestige""......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen."~9
Inception~2 November 2010~Impeccably constructed mechanics of hazy blurs~"I wonder how many different ways will Nolan find around making a heist movie. Whereas the average heist film basically makes a statement that hits a mark around ""crime doesn't pay"", a Nolan film at some point feels the need to peel back the heist film as an irrelevancy that no longer serves a purpose to give us catharsis and soaring emotional crescendos. Yet he makes his catharsis the same way he makes his heist movie framing devices, mechanical and calculated and 'movie-like'.For all the hoo hah of philosophical ambition about boxes inside boxes, this is still a movie where a plot is set in motion by characters saying things like ""we had to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago"" and where a team is assembled to work for ""some very very powerful people"". In all this furrore the make juvenile mistakes. The heir to the most powerful energy conglomerate in the world apparently flies to Los Angeles not in his personal jet but on an airline owned by his competitor. The movie hinges its believability in abstract stratagems like ""the subject's mind can always trace the genesis of that idea"".Like Shutter Island, I am bothered by this type of film that purports to speak at profound length about dreams and their mechanics, yet seems to understand nothing at all about dream logic. In Shutter Island dreams are tableaux of carefully constructed symbolism, detail planned in all the right spots to mean something. Inception is even less; dreams are vistas/levels of real world abstracted to a small degree. When a van tumbles over a bridge, the people dreaming inside that van find themselves bumping about in their dream! Where Scorsese's movie allowed for itself the failsafe of being able to claim that it's all a pastiche of 50's detective mysteries, Inception is a Nolan film so it must take itself thoroughly serious at every turn.The Nolans are really masters of film structuralism, I can't take that away from them nor do I want to, they excel in this. They are great architects who make boxes carefully fit within other boxes, an elaborate maze to lose the viewer in, but their idea of trascending box and maze is to the force the viewer into submission by sheer volume of plot detail. I like how we're given fragments of images that pay off later but at the same time can't help but feel that, outside the mechanics of it, when it comes to emotional response, those fragments never really challenge our expectations. For more than two hours, Nolan symbolizes Leo's guilt on leaving a family behind by showing him unable to dream/remember the faces of his children, always seeing their backs. In the end he does, yet, again seemingly through that architectural need to create another narrative box, the film ends on the ambiguous note ""is this another dream?"" that betrays the emotional response of the character seeing his children's faces.What annoys me most about this is two things though. That the movie seems content to give the impression that a villain, like a Minotaur in the far end of a labyrinth, inhabits the lowest level of the dream, closed in a hotel room of broken furniture, or a bleak cityscape of concrete buildings without features, and even characters who should know better refer to it in the third person like it actually exists down there as something more than a figment of Leo's subconscious.And more importantly, that Nolan creates a very elaborate system of dreams within dreams and simultaneous narratives that hinge on the idea that dream time is condensed (I find this fascinating, that entire lives can be played out in the span of time it takes a van to tumble over a bridge), yet he only fills those boxes with the most banal and unimaginative action set pieces. Dream levels are in turns hazy aimless blurs of something that is very gray and very rainy, of characters running around in orangecolored corridors, of characters running around in the snow shooting guns at each other.I'm not sure that Nolan could make a better movie even if he didn't have blockbuster expectations to fulfill or financial investments to protect, even with the ridiculous actions trimmed out, a dream version of Memento would not warrant Kubrick comparisons. For a generation that wasn't old enough to take the red pill ten years ago this should serve as a Matrix for the new decade, but when it comes to meaningfully capturing what it feels like to dream no one has yet to even rival Lynch."~0
Inception~28 February 2021~Nolan's best film by far~This is an excellent film. The CGI is great. The characters are great. But I have one problem which is the character development. It didn't have much of it, but that is the only problem. The movie did start of really confusing, but in the 40 minute part I got used to the story. In conclusion this is a great film and I would highly recommend it.? ~10
Inception~5 March 2011~A good film, but not as good as the hype~I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox~7
Inception~12 February 2011~Insipid~"Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as ""dreams within dreams is too unstable"" and ""if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg."" DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole.? "~1
Inception~30 March 2023~Just like a dream... this is pure creativity on display!~This movie never gets old! Of Christopher Nolan's movies, it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight! This really feels like a movie that only he could make! A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity, as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way, so that it never becomes too much! This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed! Soundtrack is equally great and iconic!Great actors who all does a great job! Lots of talent! The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time! This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss!~9
Inception~9 August 2010~Dreams are not even %50 human mind control... Seeing the Inception from a more realistic, Tarkovsky perspective~"~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they're frozen, they're playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate.I said para-psychologically inappropriate, 'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone's mind, it's not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with ""The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind"". There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fiancée; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person's face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* ""Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.""When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* ""You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions"" So the most important question one ever needs to ask ""How did they all start to dream implantation?"". There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, ""The Minority Report"" was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance.Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you're not a guide to someone's dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people's lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he's done. But for someone's favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn't do any thing with the good. *(3)* ""The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise""Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception's plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark.Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception's story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert's approach to criticize Nolan's earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* ""How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?"" (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone's sub-conscious, so he didn't even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn't been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense.The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they're dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it's Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries. 'CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST.*(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei Tarkovsky quotes at thinkexist.com / *(4)* : from Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, July.14.2010"~6
Inception~6 January 2011~"From ""Inception"" to Deception : a Review within a review within a rev...."~"Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with ""Inception"", one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can't get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ..."" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?"~6
Inception~13 February 2011~Lifeless. Wants too be too smart for its own good~"Can't believe the high reviews as I think it's the worst Nolan productions to date. Means: it's a good/average movie, but not great.The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"": blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn't add anything to the story.The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don't care. But I should.Meh."~4
Inception~18 November 2021~Brilliant on every level~Boring of me to say but this is one of my favourite movies of all time. Stellar performances, great plot and an ending that keeps you guessing. The CGI is exceptional and I think it's arguably one of Nolan's best films.? ~10
Inception~12 May 2020~Over long, Pretentious twaddle~This is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter I would not have been too offended. But I'm genuienly perplexed as to how people can rave over it-#13 on all time list at time of writing!! There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsence rules - any thing to get me out of that chair.? ~7
Inception~19 January 2013~This Film Is Great, But Only In Some People's Dreams~Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh.I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10~7
Inception~9 June 2020~Not impressed~This movie was (and is) beloved by everyone so I don't expect to make any friends with my honest opinion - I was not impressed by Inception. Before I first watched this film, I was told that it would be complex and mind-blowing so I expected something like Nolan's earlier The Prestige (2006) which was masterful and one of my favourite films. Instead, we get a shallow imitation of that style. Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex - it doesn't add much value to the film, and the complexity is just overloading the audience's working memory which is not a clever technique at all. The characters were the worst part of the film. Apart from the main characters, they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission. We don't have any other reason to care about them. After a point, I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded. Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence. I actually cared more about Cilian Murphy's character than the protagonists, to be honest. Because I lost my investment in the film, it just dragged out and became boring, especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow. The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful. That said, there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed. The visuals and effects were great, such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity. The best part was Hans Zimmer's score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks. Those aspects almost made up for the flaws - almost.~6
Inception~18 July 2010~Over hyped and over blown. Over and out.~"Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the ""goodies"" are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the ""baddies"" are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the ""baddies"" must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)"~5
Inception~27 March 2011~a victim of the over hype machine~i might be in the minority here but i was not blown away by this film.don't get me wrong.i enjoyed,ans it's well made,and has an interesting concept(the art of stealing a person's secrets from their subconscious while they are dreaming.but to me,it didn't(or couldn't) live up to the hype.it has its good point.it isn't boring and the acting is first rate,especially by Leonardo DiCaprio.i liked the look of the film too.many people i know have said it was so complex that they had to watch it more than once to understand it.i don't agree.i didn't find it complex at all.think it's well worth watching,but like i said,It just had too much hype to live up to.but that's just me opinion.for me,Inception is a 7/? ~7
Inception~23 July 2010~Not Your Typical, Brainless Summer Movie~"Inception (2010)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The ""kiss"" platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has pretty much ruined movies to a point as it's rare when one can walk into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know, storywise, as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me, there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there."~0
Inception~27 July 2010~"So, the ""tricky"" is now ""deep""?!?"~"I doubt anybody will read this review, since it's neither a ""fan rave"" nor a ""hated it."" The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over ""Inception"" as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of ""Tron."" If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and ""the solar system itself may just be an atom.""This may be a good film on some levels, but I didn't care for it."~4
Inception~14 November 2021~"The pieces are amazing, but the whole is ""only"" very good"~The pieces of the movie are amazing: 1. Hans Zimmer's music is hauntingly beautiful, probably my favorite movie score ever.2. The premise is unique and fascinating 3. The special effects are amazing and don't distract (unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies). They fit into the plot perfectly.4. The acting is very good.But the assemled pieces make the whole only very good, not amazing: The movie is just too big, and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes, resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth. A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good. There are two main storylines, one mostly in the present, the other about the main character's past...found myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former.~8
Inception~3 August 2010~Mindless action film about the mind...~"I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who's job it is to endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and unaffecting action you see on the screen.If you think one level of action clichés is enough to rot your brain to a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clichés, all explained for you in a ""hey this isn't very interesting but we've created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the gunfights in a dreamworld"".I'd probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120 minutes (I left early) back.? "~2
Inception~14 December 2010~"It lacked ""the willing suspension of disbelief"" that good movies produce."~"There were only a handful of moments throughout ""Inception"" where I didn't feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: ""Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!""I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the ""kicks"" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was ""kicked"" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog."~5
Inception~4 April 2011~The ultimate mind-f**k movie? Dream on.~At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects—which are undeniably impressive—whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous.~5
Inception~27 June 2011~Good news, bad news~"Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see it.Bad news, I got to see the movie.I was really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again, chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon. There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwords.My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writers.As the old commercial asked ""Is it real or is it Memorex?"" Who cares?"~4
Inception~9 January 2011~What kind of an accomplishment is it to be a born liar ?~"Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception."~4
Inception~19 August 2010~A good idea that wasn't planted well~"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Memento & The Dark Knight are my favourite movies but for the first time I am disappointed with his movie Inception. The film is all about is all about stealing & planting ideas in people's mind by using their dreams.The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length that drags really badly, plot holes & unanswered questions & Cobb's annoying wife ruined the whole movie.Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again for the second time because it wasn't that confusing and it boring throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel dream looked cool. Cobb's wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they still couldn't explain anything.Inception isn't even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated movie called ""Paprika"" which was out in 2006.I don't know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of written that ""Inception is good"" on a piece of paper and planted it in people's mind although it's not."~5
Inception~7 January 2011~The name is Willis.. , Bruce Willis...And I should have been in this movie.~I don't know what it is about this movie that people get so carried away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did.I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees.Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled. Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who can't tell, and couldn't care less to be able to tell, shït from Shinola.5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound editing.~1
Inception~5 August 2010~Think I've failed my A-Level Filmgoing~"Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline?If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed."~4
Inception~30 October 2011~What are you drinking??~"Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S FILMS.The problem and it isn't about rating movies only ,but let's say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write reviews ,haven't seen great people in their lifetime and can't comprehend what their real value was.It's different to listen from other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they were in their prime.It's different to listen from other people about the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they performed in the 60's.So OK,i won't be surprised if Justin Bieber on an online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are 70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this ""masterpiece"" might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not thousands).I think it's the only film ,that IMDb shouldn't care about spoilers,because you can't spoil a storyline that doesn't exist. Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception."~1
Inception~11 August 2010~Dream a Little Dream of Me~"Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold and pompous high gloss product that's masquerading as intelligent mainstream entertainment.It's such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics (and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as ""Matrix"", though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.)One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing deeper thoughts or emotions. One's much too puzzled to feel anything.By the way, this must've been the longest showdown I've ever seen in any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts"~5
Inception~24 July 2010~A nightmare.~"This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess."~1
Inception~24 July 2010~The Emperors New Clothes~Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather.And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.~1
Inception~24 July 2010~A Brilliant Piece~"There is no way ""Inception"" will be a bad movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe this movie and those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting, overwhelming, entertaining, and awesome. ""Inception"" might be the only movie this summer that has an original concept.""Inception"" is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals were overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and mind-bending.The performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie. Cillian Murphy is disappointing though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is flawless.""Inception"" is mind-bending and non-stop entertaining. Once again Christopher Nolan made another successful blockbuster. ""Inception"" might be the best movie of the year.? "~10
Inception~25 July 2010~Stupid, dull and frustrating~"A mess about ""mind pirates""...or something. They enter peoples minds, bend reality and are hired to help a man to change his dying fathers mind to get control of his estate...but there are OTHER people who are trying to stop them.Wow! What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to ""get it"" and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember ""The Matrix"" from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before (""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island""). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were. Dull, annoying and very full of itself. Don't bother."~1
Inception~4 March 2011~more glitz than substance~"""Inception"" seems to be taking the premises of such films as ""Peter Ibbetson,"" ""Altered States,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to more elaborate lengths. Throughout this action flick – and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses – I couldn't help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn't believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care.With ""Inception"" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they ""share"" and ""engineer"" other people's dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in ""Eternal Sunshine""). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan's dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer's juices.Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others."~3
Inception~2 December 2010~Deception of Insheeption~"NOTE: Nolan fanboys are going to hate my review, don't even bother to send me PM's saying ""U SUCK, YOUR TASTE SUX"". Don't even bother to report this review hoping that someone will delete it, it will prove that fanboys are a bunch of keyboard warriors trying to ""deffend"" everything in the most ridiculous way.Everyone is saying that this is the best movie of the year and saying that ""it looks like an Alfred Hitchcok movie""....it doesn't even come close from the masterpieces of Hitchcok ! Everyone gave this movie a 10 star rating even if they didn't saw it, because it was from the director of The Dark Knight (another disappointment, but less painful than this piece of crap), the audience are a bunch of sheeps.The story is predictable, the twists are predictable, the action scenes sucks, they sucked so much that i almost missed the ""action"" sequence of the Transformers movies (the live action ones).Why i give this movie a 2 stars ? one star for the cast and another one for the musical score.UPDATE: i had the misfortune to rewatch this piece of crap and my vote is 1, truly awful."~1
Inception~1 November 2010~A whole lot of nothing~Damn this film rates high on IMDb, but I am not one for ratings. I think a great film is like food, we have all different taste, and this did not taste well for me. Sure it's glossy, great special effects, great cast. But this film is all over the place, just to many angle's with in an angle. Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat. I gave it a 3 out of 10, as visually it is pleasing.? ~3
Inception~17 April 2011~I MUST be dreaming~"I only arrived at the 35 minutes mark on this one and I had to turn it off. I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and ""interesting"" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie. The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only made it worse, since they were supporting crap."~2
Inception~29 December 2016~Interesting and creative but with minor flaws.~This film revolves around the theft of ideas, pushed to the limit, with the thief entering into the mind of another person through a dream made for that purpose. It has the main actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (all in the guise of a team of thieves of ideas) and Ken Watanabe (in the role of a powerful Japanese chairman). Christopher Nolan took charge of the script and direction.It is undoubtedly an interesting, intellectually challenging and well-crafted film. The rich and intricate script gives us a solid, well-imagined story with good characters (the two main characters, attributed to DiCaprio and Watanabe, are even more worked and function as antagonists). Despite this, the contained and reserved form as the characters demonstrate emotions makes the movie a bit cold from the emotional point of view. The emotions are there, they just prefer to demonstrate them in a discreet way. The script could have even explored the emotional and psychological consequences of stealing ideas, for the thief and for those who are robbed, but prefers to remain in the realm of material consequences. The end of the film is good but, from a certain moment, it becomes slow and predictable. Despite this, praise is given to the performance of Nolan as well as the main actors. DiCaprio fulfilled our expectations, Ellen Page was a pleasant surprise and the rest of the cast was up to the challenge.Although not a perfect movie, there is no doubt that it is good. It's a movie that will be more pleasing to the more intellectual, audiences who do not like movies where thinking is needed to understand it will probably have more difficulty in enjoying it.~7
Inception~6 March 2011~Slogging work to watch...~The only moments that had dream-like qualities in the movie were the times I dozed off & my own dreams (many times more imaginative I might add) took over.To be blunt about it, Inception is not so much about dreams as about the world of video games. Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters explain in overly verbose dialog where & when each segment was taking place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.). Like having to follow instructions of a poorly designed game. Ugh.The popularity of this snoozer is very sad testimony to the mediocrity of the average movie-going intelligence.? ~1
Inception~1 September 2010~Are you people watching the same film as me!!????~OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable.~5
Inception~11 March 2017~Great Concept, Decent Execution~"This film features one of the most innovative concepts of all-time, that of ""dreams within dreams"" and similar fare. But is it a classic? Not quite, due to some ""can't quite put my finger on it"" lack of overall execution.For a basic plot summary, ""Inception"" deals in the world of shared dreams, in which individuals (while asleep) can enter the dream of another and insert/extract information. When an ""inception"" team (led by Leonardo DiCaprio) is put together for an especially difficult assignment, they must go deeper into the mark's head than ever before.In terms of grandiose ideas, ""Inception"" is truly a mind-boggling concept that will intrigue you right from the get-go. The visual effects are spectacular and innovative, while the whole scope of the movie is often staggering.Here's the ""problem"", though: This isn't a movie that will stick with me for any prolonged period of time (and thus makes me unable to give it five stars). The plot execution and character development just left a little too much to be desired in sacrifice to the ideas. I can't quite put my finger on it, but (besides the incredible science fiction"", ""Inception"" just isn't an all-time classic.Thus, while an entertaining watch, I rank ""Inception"" well below ""The Matrix"" (very similar concepts) and about on par with ""Shutter Island"". Enjoy it far what it is, but don't expect it to be the greatest movie you've ever seen."~7
Inception~21 January 2011~Disappointed..... No Hard Feelings.~Disappointed, Oh yes I am Disappointed. Why, Because I had high expectations. Why I had High Expectations? Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10. And I am not crying its over-rated since most of people have really liked it.? ~5
Inception~5 January 2011~Not as good as I expected it to be after all the hype.~"This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.Don't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.Technically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.But you won't get much else from it.I'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read ""?"" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story."~7
Inception~18 November 2021~Perfect for Sci-Fi Fans~"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says ""Inception"" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of ""Dark Knight,"" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie ""The Matrix"" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film."~10
Inception~11 December 2020~Am I dreaming~"Though this was a very good, on your toes, don't blink kind of movie. In the end, I had to ask myself, ""Was it all a dream?"". Acting superb and directing on point. Very good movie.? "~8
Inception~15 July 2010~A Mutli-Layered Dream World~"What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and most recently, ""The Dark Knight.""This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of ""The Matrix,"" and even Leo's latest (excellent) work ""Shutter Island,"" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, ""Inception"" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, ""Inception"" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again."~8
Inception~30 December 2010~Overdone, too long, too complicated, too unrealistic~Well, after writing my summary maybe I don't need to write a review.First off, this isn't really my type of film. But I watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible.But the film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry. For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly. Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah.I frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it was over. I don't understand all the fuss over this.~4
Inception~24 July 2010~Overlong and Overrated~"I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success.? "~1
Inception~4 December 2021~Can't believe it's rated this high~"That fact this movie has an 8.8 Rating shows people's desire to be perceived as being intelligent. This movie is unnecessarily complicated for the sake of being complicated. The story telling is terrible. If a character in a story has to tell the audience directly what the hell is going on the story sucks. A lot of Christopher Nolan's stuff is like this. Whenever someone hears criticism of Inception the first line of attack is ""you just didn't understand it"". I understood it, just didn't like the way it was presented.Having said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and some of his stuff is good. He is still one of the only director's today that uses practical effects. The hallway rotating scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing. Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a 5/10.? "~5
Inception~31 December 2010~Bad, slow, pretentious.~"This overly-hyped movie tried to be too clever by half and didn't even manage to pull off a Matrix-type pretentiousness. It's just bad, substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It's science fiction and fantasy, it doesn't have to conform to real life but it should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called ""levels"" to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting visuals, but that's all there is.? "~1
Inception~19 December 2010~I prefer my dreams...~OK, Inception can be the best rated movie of 2010, but not for me. I'm not questioning its quality as an action movie but yes as a sci-fi production because after The Matrix this movie seems much more illogical exactly for trying to be more realistic and fully coherent and cohesive. Also, it's impossible not compare it to The Matrix as Christopher Nolan already stated that the idea for the movie came from movies like The Matrix, The 13th Floor and The Dark City. That's so inspired by these movies - mainly The Matrix - that some references to it are a lot clear: the red and blue button in the briefcase (like the red and blue pill), the architect, a group which each one of them has an specific ability, the idea (meaning the virus), the dream soldiers (as the anti-virus), the totem (like the telephone), among others...Who pays attention to dreams or is familiar to the basics of it knows that the movie is right in some points but lacks of several other characteristics. When you're in a lucid dream you're able to control it and direct events and happenings, that's why you're able do dream a lucid dream and back to it even if you wake up for a short time. In unconscious dream you're unable to control it, that's why we mostly wake up when we die or when we fall, because in a lucid dream you're able to 'defend' yourself as you wish. The world of unconscious dream, where most of the film tries to reproduce as the characters are in a pre-coma state, is a lot more confusing and chaotic than it seems. It could have been much more explored if wasn't given so much attention for action sequences. The only time where seems like a real and chaotic dream is when a train crosses an entire street. At that moment I thought that things would be visually interesting, but it never was.Trying to give more attention for the action and not for science, the characters have a magic pack that connects several people into a dreamer's dream without reason. In The Matrix they have those huge machines that are connected in their minds to fully transfer people to a dream world previously built, making 2 or more people share the same dream space. That makes The Matrix more acceptable in this explanation than Inception. Scientists believe that sharing a dream is possible as the brain is moved by electric impulses, so, if we have a main board able to unify and decode those electric impulses, this could be possible. But in Inception what really connects them all? Just a powerful sedative? Are they super heroes or what? That's why I think that The Matrix is much more successful when exploring this idea, because it starts from a solid scientific one.While The Matrix deals with an electronic generated world, in Inception we are talking about a dream where there are cities, people, mobiles that works, explosives, car crashing, people dying and bleeding and whatever... but never the power of imagination. Work about the inception of an idea is a great plot, and the barriers for that could be anything than just a bunch of armored guys shooting and exploding everything.Inception for me is just a redone idea, the same as Avatar is to Pochahontas, but Inception doesn't give me anything new or add something interesting among other interesting ones I've seen before. The media calls it one of the best movies of 2010 and one of the best sci-fi movies of the time and that actually insults my intelligence because there's nothing new there. But the industry needs to make money from something times to times and they found Inception a great money machine. Technically the movie is superb and a great action flick, but I don't see anything more from it.I give 5 stars just as an action movie, because thinking as a sci-fi, I give it none. There's a lot for nothing... or maybe, a lot for just in the end the movie explains that incept an idea is so difficult as I trying to convince you that this movie isn't so good as it seems.~5
Inception~28 October 2010~Very disappointing action packed Di Caprio drama~I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which surely does have some psychological connection with this movie in'playing with our minds'. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I couldn't really follow 'Inception' and as a native Englishman, I am still unsure as to the meaning of the word 'Inception' for the context of the film.The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is 'not' Bourne Supremacy' or 'Salt' and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film and couldn't, so I became frustrated.Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of movies like 'The Matrix' while watching it. Why oh why did the director have to 'overcook' this movie.We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see, sorry!~5
Inception~1 November 2010~A well made but boring film.~"I wanted to like Inception because I think most of the people involved are talented, but it is just an endless exposition of the ever-changing 'rules' of the dreamworld. It's a shame. It isn't confusing, but it is very boring. There are no engaging characters and it has no trace of humour. It does have some good performances and... nope, that's it.It's not a terrible film, it's just very very dull. When all rules are taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a few FX set-pieces which don't, even at a most basic level, do anything to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like? It's like reading a dream diary - a fragmented collection of somebody else's ultimately vapid ideas. It's worth watching once to say ""Was that it?"" and shrug.Watch Mr Nobody instead. It takes Nolan to school.? "~4
Inception~10 September 2011~Definitely not dreamy~Okay, maybe this movie isn't awful. It's closer to mediocre, but I just can't resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film's methodical score swells and swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying. It's all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you concentrate very hard, you can decode the film's narrative trick of dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel dreamscapes.But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little. The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don't care what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while performing stunts.By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at Inception's ability to mask— or at the very least waste— his considerable talent.As for the movie's imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the movie's narrative trope— a dream within a dream within a dream— it becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams-- Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these movies? Has he ever even had a dream?In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks emotional depth or provocative imagery. It's a notch above Hollywood's typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch.~1
Inception~1 November 2010~Something is missing...~"Call me ""dumb"", I do not care, because I have my own mind and experience and I know by now that I am not. My only reserve is that maybe I should see it twice, or that this is not the moment for me to have seen it( As is with reading books, today one can't stand it , tomorrow it makes perfect sense). Apart from this, a movie being an experience destined to consume itself at the maximum in one ""kick"", after this Inception experience, I feel that something is really missing here. What is the idea of this movie? What is it trying to express? In what system of beliefs is all this taking place? Because, apart from the famous cast, the good performances, the special effects that are everywhere and the incessant and disturbing gun noises, I do not see what am I supposed to get enriched with through watching this movie? OK, the idea of conscious dreaming is centuries-old, so is the idea of ""staging"" the life or the universe(no need to mention the link to Matrix, etc), but who would be the ""dreamer"" if we extrapolated to our lives? Because the thought of a world meant just for corporations and ""important"" individuals, I do not like. So, in a person's life, any person, how are the Inception ideas fitting in? Are we to look and see who ""dreams"" for us, and the movie couldn't put this idea bluntly? Are we dealing with an explanation for wave function collapse, controlled consciously by some skilled to do so and implementing during our sleep? I feel the need to say, ""please explain yourself"". One cannot mount such a giant of a movie (publicity, effects, cast and so), and in the end leave you with a bigger blur than before such ideas occurred. I would say it is either a case of snobbish commercialism that is not backed up by enough understanding and research, or a case of intricate mind and ideas that have no clarity in expressing themselves. It is an exercise for the brain, I give it that. But in the light of too much gratuitous violence, too less contoured universe of the movie, too crowded action, too soapy emotional effects (the passed away wife, the uncommunicative rich father) and too high praise that it deserves (c'mon, this is the new Matrix? Are we going back as the time goes by?, I feel deeply not pleased."~0
Inception~19 March 2013~That is not how imagination works~Good points. Well, the visuals were great that's for sure. The way they bent reality and had rooms spin and cities shift and stuff blow up, sure, great action. The soundtrack is good as well but it doesn't have any memorable tunes.Bad points. What the hell was that action all about? Projections of someone's mind were typical people attacking the incerptors. Am I to believe that the ultimate defense a person's mind has is... faceless mooks? Where are the dragons, the supermen, the giant robots? Something that is NOT faceless mooks? If this is the realm of dreams then it should be filled with such stuff, there is no holding back. Not even the most pragmatic mind would be without such stuff. So here I am watching an hour long action scene that is better fit for a James Bond film (minus the rotating rooms) than an adventure in the subconscious mind of troubled men. Makes little sense.Then the dialogues. Although the explanations around how the inception works were great and I did understand the concept, I found that it took a huge chunk of the duration. Half of the dialogues feel like the characters are indirectly explaining the theory to us. Something that they wouldn't since they are supposed to know such stuff and have no need to mention them.Good point. The story is indeed interesting and offers a concept around the blurring of reality that has never been offered exactly like this before.Bad point. The actual plot outside the interesting concept is mostly thrown away at shoot outs and explosions with random mooks that have nothing to do with a person's mind. If I dream something, I am the dream. Everyone is me, everyone acts like me, everything reacts like me. Yet the movie wants us to think our dream is like reality. I was not convinced that a dreamworld is so stiff. It was changing all right but the moment someone knows he is dreaming and doesn't wake up, he doesn't need to run or hide. He can mold everything where he stands and play it God. Thus the movie doesn't literally show how dreams work. It just gives you some nice ideas and wastes the rest in action scenes you can find even in a normal action movie.Acting... no good or bad points here. There are no prevailing characters for all I care. The idea and the action overshadow the actors. Di Caprio and the gang did their parts well but I still find it hard to believe that such an unstable personality that has his murderous wife chasing him in dreams would be allowed to go on in such delicate missions. It's like inviting Freddy Krugger to chop you to pieces while the world hangs at the edge of the cliff. Bad plot element.So is this movie good? In theory, yes. Action lovers and eggheads will love it. Scriptwritters may get some nice ideas from. But as far as I care it is NOT a masterpiece. It has too many convenient events, too much holding back, too much infodump, too much out-of place action.Things that I would change to make this movie better: -No shootings with faceless mooks and blowing stuff just for the heck of it. -More dream morphing scenes in places of fore-mentioned pointless action. -Less infodump. -Less corny dead wife drama. We have Solaris for that.The Cage is a movie doing a rather better portrait of a man's dreamworld. Not so much mambo jumbo around how it works but shows it better. And of course there is Solaris (dead wife thing) and Matrix (cool action) and James Bond (shooting and blowing stuff) to take out most other good parts of the movie. By the end of it, only the idea of inception is what stands out. And it wasn't exploited that much really.~6
Inception~9 August 2011~Mr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician~"Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not ""my director"". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the ""dreams"" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, ""the street bending"" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the ""snow"" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the ""train scene"" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The ""gravity"" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted."~7
Inception~23 July 2010~Boring nightmares of a disturbed person~I am beating myself up because I fell for the hype. Unfortunately I spend money on that nightmare, next time I go to a movie which has been so hyped I make sure it is a free screening. It is a nightmare. If you have these kinds of dreams you are a deeply disturbed person. Shooting, car crashes, explosions, shootings, car crashes, explosions that is all that troubled soul dreams about. I usually do not go to movies consisting of shootings, explosions, car crashes and crumbling buildings. Only when I really feel that a movie gives a realistic rendering of war will I go and see such a movie because I am trying to understand that part of human nature.But I went. It was hot and I thought it would be nice to sit in a cool movie theater. Well first the movie theater was warm and I had to fight to stay awake , then they switched the air-conditioning on high and we all got frozen. I was hanging in checking my watch every three minutes and hoping that eventually I would see that great movie people were raving about. Nothing. After 148 painful and boring minutes I tried to getup and leave but was frozen stiff and it took me a few seconds to get moving. The credits had just started rolling but the movie theater was already empty, obviously everybody could not wait to leave. There were only a few people anyway in the afternoon show. This was my first movie in eight months because there was absolutely nothing worthwhile seeing in the theaters nearby. I love to go to the movies and I love the big screen so when the ticket lady asked me if I wanted XP I said yes. I was disappointed by that too. Not worth the money. Hopefully there will some movie I want to see in the coming months, otherwise I will stick to books.~1
Inception~2 August 2010~Number one turkey of the year!~This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing  Just horrible~1
Inception~20 October 2019~Does Christopher Nolan Dream of Electric Sheep?~The problem with Inception is that its execution doesn't fit its subject matter. This is supposed to be a movie about dreams...so where is the dream-like quality? It's not abstract, it's very cold and calculated - it's all to linear - a perfectly plotted beginning-middle-end story; ffs, even the dreams have rules! Since when do dreams have rules? Or even a through-line? It's not a murky shade, it's just cold mechanical computer-generated imagery like all Hollywood productions. This might be how robots dream in binary, but not the ungraspable mystique of how organisms dream, something that the likes of Tarkovsky, Bergman or early practical films conjured up both movingly and authentically, and at times down-right creepily. Nolan's clockwork extravaganza is as devoid of personality as the man himself. To look into one's dreams would be intimate - Nolan eschews intimacy for spectacle generated by 1's and 0's.? ~5
Inception~12 December 2010~Overrated Mess~"In the future, the industrial spy Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has the ability to steal secrets from the dreams of executives. When his beloved wife committed suicide in the past, he was falsely accused of murder and now he is an international fugitive that can not return to USA to be with his children. When Cobb meets the powerful Saito (Ken Watanabe), the executive offers a unique chance to him to clear his records. In return, Cobb shall plant an inception in the mind of the heir Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to avoid that the company he had inherited from his father becomes a monopoly in energy in the future. Cobb lost the capability to build dreams and together with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), they team up with the trainee in architecture Ariadne (Ellen Page); with the expert Eames (Tom Hardy); and with the chemistry Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to enter in different levels of Robert's dream and plant the inception.""Inception"" is an overrated mess and my greatest deception in 2011. I do not understand the hype surrounding this film, probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think, with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer. The best part of this film is the hilarious IMDb User Rating that reflects how brainless the Hollywood cinema has become in the contemporary days. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Origem"" (""The Inception"")"~6
Inception~9 October 2011~Juno Does Reality on LSD~I was trying my best to keep from falling asleep. What purports to be a breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate, high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn't decide, I suppose, whether he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor. Leo Dicapprio's character is insipid. Ellen Page's character is two sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I couldn't care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much sense. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare, looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this one. Methinks now, I'll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself in.? ~1
Inception~2 February 2021~Very boring and hard to watch~In my opinion, this film was tough to watch because it was just boring to me. I get the idea of the storyline but dang.. I fell asleep the first time and second time watching it, I wished I fell asleep. People praise it like it's sooooo good but I feel like those types are easily impressed no offense..? ~2
Inception~10 February 2021~Masterpiece~This movie has everything. The production and cinematography is exceptional. The story line is original and forces you to think and challenge your thoughts. It's a perfect balance of imaginative and complex. The acting lives up to their names to deliver top notch performances.? ~9
Inception~28 May 2011~Dazzles like cheap jewelery~"While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it's effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a 'reductio' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein's proof against skepticism) but it's true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, ""Gravity's Rainbow"", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically.Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable."~3
Inception~20 November 2011~I just don't get it.~Di Caprio plays Cobb, an expert in extracting information from people's minds by infiltrating a target's dream. In return for a new identity, which will allow him again to go to the States to be with his kids, Cobb is challenged to now plant an idea in someone's mind in stead of retrieving it.The premise of the film is rather silly but it's the execution that truly ruins the film. The major issue is without a doubt the exposition ridden dialog which didn't progress the overall plot or added anything in terms of character development. In stead we get the most expensive cast doing little else than yammer on and on about the totally uninteresting and far-fetched technical methods that are involved in dream infiltration as Nolan's showcases his unimaginative and clueless take on the Sci-Fi genre. In between these witless and thoroughly boring expositions, we get treated to the action clichés from every Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4 decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply with every subsequent scene.Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was everything happening in this film without exception utterly implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why wasn't this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?The fans are right, I don't get it.~1
Inception~5 January 2020~Brilliantly creative and well realized.~Inception is a movie you just have to see before you judge it. Maybe you should even see it twice. There are a lot of complex ideas here, and the movie spends a good chunk of time explaining them in the opening act. That main idea though, is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking, everything you'd expect from a Christopher Nolan film. Writing and performances are also great across the board. The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation. Some may says it's pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy aren't fully understood by the creators and/or don't make sense. But I think that's a terrible angle to approach the film. It's Sci-Fi, you're not supposed to over-anylasie it in that way. It's meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head, which I beleive it does very well, not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea. Yes, it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios, esspecally at the end, but it doesn't drag the rest of the movie down at all to me. It's a must watch? ~9
Inception~16 July 2010~Your mind is the scene of the crime~"INCEPTION is a film in which you want to go in knowing nothing because it's best seen with no prior knowledge. So I'm just going to not say a word about the plot and have the film unfold in front of you, sometimes literally. It's pretty difficult to explain what INCEPTION really is because it's damn packed with so many interesting ideas. Really, when you come out of the theater, you'll only think, ""What did I just see?"" The film is filled with so much ambition and so many original ideas that it captivates you. In fact, I think this is the fastest 150 minute film I've ever seen because it felt like 80 minutes! I really wanted to see more when the credits rolled.Unfortunately, INCEPTION isn't a perfect film. It falls short on its ambition. Some ideas weren't as developed as I hope they would be and others weren't presented clear enough. In fact, it's as if the characters spoke in another type of jargon exclusively made for psychologists pursuing in the career of dreams. Also, the story isn't all that special. Another common complaint you might hear about the film is that the characters are flat. It's true. The film presents us with six or seven characters but does absolutely nothing with them. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is the only character that's fleshed out. In some cases, I didn't care for the characters when their lives were at stake.Still, the performances by the ensemble cast are really good. I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy in their roles a lot. I might not be the only person to notice this but I thought Leonardo DiCaprio played the exact same character as he did in SHUTTER ISLAND. I couldn't get past Ken Watanabe's thick accent. It was hard to understand him in many of his scenes. Marion Cotillard did a great job, though.The film is also visually intricate, if that makes sense and even that description doesn't give the film justice. Again, it's really hard to explain. The visual effects were really excellent along with the action scenes but don't expect this film to be filled with action. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (AKA: One of the best composers ever) is fantastic, much like Zimmer's other soundtracks.Overall, INCEPTION is a flawed but seriously excellent film that presents some very, very, very interesting ideas. It's a wholly original film, which is great considering the amount of remakes, re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, etc. that we've gotten in the past few years, let alone this year. The characters could have been fleshed out a lot more. Still, I was absolutely engaged throughout by the story, and Christopher Nolan's ingenious script and direction just sucks you in. This is the perfect cure for this year's lackluster summer."~7
Inception~3 August 2010~What?~I haven't got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps something about controlling other people's dreams, to get what you want. In this case it's once again the evil corporation, which wants to rule the world. OK, great.In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide. You can see Paris upside down if you're interested, but really, the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you're bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140 minutes to go. A serious warning about this.? ~3
Inception~12 June 2022~Blah~I tried to watch this in a theater when it came out and fell asleep. I finally got thru it many years later. Idk I loved Interstellar thought it was fantastic but this was super boring. I should have liked it I just didn't and I can't explain why. Seems like the writers and such just tried to hard.? ~5
Inception~15 August 2010~Who dreamed this fodder?~For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?~5
Inception~18 July 2010~Give him the kick~Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet.The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you til it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10~8
Inception~1 March 2021~Great movie, and concept.~I really liked this movie, it is long but keeps you intrigued and interested. What I didn't like and made me want to stop watching it is the score, there is way too much of it, too overwhelming that the characters don't have any personality, all emotions are driven by the score and the orchestral backdrop really. This is present in most Hollywood movies, which is unfortunate.? ~7
Inception~29 January 2012~A beautiful surface,hollow content. Gifted cast wasted and Nolan gets stuck between reinvention and desperate pretensions.~"Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues.Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope.Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along.You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well.Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement.2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs.3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever.Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So...No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them.The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad.A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation.DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow."~5
Inception~26 July 2012~Desperately loved by stupid people who want to appear smart...~There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be.I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form.~7
Inception~21 July 2010~Dream Team~Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction.I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.~9
Inception~15 July 2010~Inception is movie perfection!~Super blown away by Inception! I can't get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!!He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!? ~10
Inception~3 December 2010~Good idea, bad development~"Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie, however its not done as creatively as something like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"". Looking past that there was good potential for character development, but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one.I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion.In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end.On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time passes,their real value diminishes.This movie deserves a 6-7 and nothing more."~6
Inception~4 February 2011~Over blown and over rated~Don't believe the hype on this one. Its not a bad movie and has some interesting ideas. But its not the birth of a new religion - as some would have it. How this is mentioned in the same sentence as the 'Kings Speech' is beyond me.In general Im delighted to see any attempt to muck around with the usual narrative sequence or which mixes dream with reality. Mememto was a staggering film and I loved the Matrix 1.But after some early promise of mind altering visuals - the majority of the film was played out in what were disappointingly normal landscapes. They reminded me of conventional bond movie sets than anything else. Where was the Escher stair case? Where was the warping of physics? I felt a little let down to be honest. It was only when we reached level four that I became a little more engaged and impressed.The story line itself I felt badly cluttered with too many explanations of the mechanics of invading dreams. It was nearly always noisy and the dialogue often muffled. This made it hard to follow - (and yes, my hearing is fine and I have a state of the art Theatre system) But the really disappointing thing was that with a concept as subtle as invading peoples dreams and planting new ideas - we had to have gun fights all over the place. Frankly the crassness of the shoot outs clashed rather awkwardly with some intelligent ideas about the nature of reality. And why did all the baddies have 'A-team' shooting accuracy? Last point - wouldn't it have been rather easier to persuade the target to do what they needed him to - through non-dream means?~6
Inception~1 March 2022~silly~Christopher Nolan clearly puts a lot of work in this film and because I'm sure people also love it but all the effort is wasted on this silly story. All the reason of lots and guns and explosions, seems to me.? ~5
Inception~30 December 2016~Didactic, but nonetheless a good movie.~Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of timeNot that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works.Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues.Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.~9
Inception~14 October 2010~One of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.~As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.You can't get much more of a creative license than have dreams and dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'.~3
Inception~31 May 2012~Nolan's worst film. A great caper movie morphs into a terrible action flick.~"As Christopher Nolan's budgets get bigger, his movies get worse. He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn't overly ambitious. With his more ""epic"", ""blockbuster"" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad. It is nothing but the same loud, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, and boring action that has spread throughout movies nowadays like a disease.For at least the first hour, I could see why this movie got such great reviews. It presents itself initially as a dark and surreal Ocean's Eleven. The first act is spent acquainting us with the rules of dream thievery while the main character, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), assembles his ""safecracking"" team. In typical caper movie fashion, he finds the specialists that he needs, all of whom have their own talents and personalities. There is the chemist who will whip up the special cocktail needed to sedate everyone for this special job. There the dream actor who can impersonate anyone. There is the financier who hired Cobb and wants to come along to monitor his investment. There is the architect responsible for building the dreamscapes in which the ""safecrackers"" will pull off their caper. The target of this scheme is Robert Fischer (Cilian Murphy), the sole heir to a huge corporate empire. The purpose of this scheme is not to steal anything, but to implant the idea into Fischer's head that he should break up his father's empire. To do that, Cobb and his buddies concoct an incredibly complex scheme that involves a dream within a dream within a dream.For a while, I thought that I was in heaven. But then, in Act II when the caper officially starts, I began to feel doubts. Within minutes, there is a massive car chase and the bullets are flying from all directions. When the dreaming starts, you get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like. Tons and tons of shooting, chases, and action that drags on and on despite having almost no relevance to the plot. It's bad in the dream, it's pretty bad in the dream within a dream, and Holy Jesus, is it ever awful in the dream within a dream within a dream.As the movie progresses, the action becomes more pointless and the action scenes become progressively harder to follow. Dozens of guys who dress like Secret Service agents are gunned down or karate chopped to death. Approximately a half hour is one gigantic non-stop action scene that takes place across all of the dream levels. While the idea of a half hour of non-stop action might sound nice, it drags horribly. Almost no plot development takes place this entire time. There is a shot of a van slowly falling towards the water. Across the long action scene, that van is shown about five or six times. By the time that you are done with this movie, you will be sick to death of seeing that stupid van falling towards the water.Why is it that this movie can't make gunfire and car chases exciting? For starters, the action is very poorly choreographed. You get no sense of location. The challenges that the good guys are facing aren't clearly laid out. Who is where? How many bad guys are there? What you do get is good old shaky-cam, loads of CGI, Matrix-inspired floating, and close-ups of dudes shooting guns. In other words, you get the crap that has virtually destroyed action movies nowadays. Today's directors could learn a lot from action classics like Commando and Die Hard.Speaking of CGI, this movie also has tons of that, and it is technologically impressive, but mostly pointless. The one scene that everybody seems to rave about is the Paris scene where half of the city gets folded in over itself. Eh – whatever. It looks cool, but – who cares? When did this become part of having a great movie? And why is it that the Road Warrior and the original Star Wars still look cooler to me than modern movies with five times the budget?While I enjoyed most of the non-action parts, this also is probably Nolan's most pretentious movie. The movie starts with the line ""What is the most resilient parasite?"" The answer: ""an idea"". What is this twaddle? Ideas aren't like parasites. I'm constantly seeing ideas brought up, shot down, and forgotten about. And why do you need to tell me this – to look smart? Inception is constantly throwing new dream rules at you, and by the end they are a confusing mess. It is these kinds of problems that inspire people to criticize Inception as being a dumb movie that tries to position itself as a smart one.To sum it all up, I think that Inception, in 20 years, will not be viewed by Christopher Nolan fans as one of his best. In fact, I believe that it is his worst film. This guy cannot do good action, and when he has a budget to spend, it seems to just make the movie longer and prettier, but not better. From these criticisms, you might get the impression that I hated the movie. I didn't. Even during the most boring scenes, I wanted the whole scheme to work, and I cared about Dom Cobb enough to be hoping that he would triumph in the end. I did enjoy it enough to watch the movie a second time, just to see if I would like it better. I had the same feelings again – falling in love at first, only to be disappointed in the end."~6
Inception~13 July 2018~Pretentious claptrap for people with an inflated sense of intelligence~Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' often gets a mention in many 'best films of all time' lists, despite the fact that this is probably one of the least rewarding and most pointless films I've ever watched.It spends the whole of its bloated two-and-a-half hour running length trying to prove how intellectually superior it is, yet requires the characters to spell out virtually every development of the ridiculously messy and convoluted plot.An intentionally complex and non-linear storyline is not smart, but pretentious filmmaking. What exactly is the point in such a bewildering minefield of a plot in which the ending presents more questions than the start? The only reason I can think of is to satisfy the ego of those who like to think of themselves as smarter than they actually are.'Inception' is one of the most overhyped, overrated and pretentious films I've ever seen.~4
Inception~16 July 2010~Anything Is Possible~If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of.I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery.I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will.~10
Inception~11 January 2011~A magnificent dream that falls short on its execution~Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.? ~4
Inception~26 October 2011~Not a movie i could get into.~This has to be for me one of the biggest load of monkey crap i have ever seen.i was bored throughout the whole movie.The best part was when the credits rolled.I enjoy movies like time cop and total recall etc,but i really couldn't enjoy this no matter how much i tried to.I don't know how this got an 8/10 rating to be honest.If you are bored and have nothing else to do,you will just be even more bored watching this.I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in movies like Titanic,Catch me if you can,The Beach etc.But this is one of his worst for me personally.I have now wasted two and half hours of my life, which i will never get back.Watching this movie makes me think comeback Steven Seagal all is forgiven.I think i need to lie down after having watched this awful film.I love films and have watched a lot over the years.And sometimes if i like them i will watch them again,This i definitely wont be watching again.I don't drink,but this movie would drive you to it.? ~1
Inception~24 July 2011~I thought it was a little too out there.~I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing.? ~5
Inception~23 November 2021~Nolan's best~I first started watching Nolan movies with Memento like 20 years ago when I was a teenager, then went to the cinema to see all three of his Batman movies, The Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar.I really think that it can be hard to decide which of his movies truly is his definitive best, as he has a few that hit the mark just right. But from re-watching them a bunch over the years, I do feel that Inception hits the hardest, even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from Inception.I watch movies for the magic and emotion, and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted, the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I think.I love the cast of Inception; especially the incredible performances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page.Those four actors in this movie are pure magic, especially accented with Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe, along with everyone else.The holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least, are Inception, Interstellar, and The Dark Knight, with The Prestige and Memento not far behind.I can't wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus, one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number 1 spot. I feel that if any living director can do it, it would be Nolan.~10
Inception~3 September 2010~Too contrived~"INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10"~3
Inception~5 August 2010~"""Take a leap of faith..."""~"Writer-director Christopher Nolan's byzantine puzzle-movie ""Inception"" is so fully engulfed in a surreal sort of Raison d'être--while also managing to introduce a new set of rules to us, though not appearing to abide by those rules near the finale--it's easy to understand why some audiences are embracing the film as a masterpiece. These days, if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption, but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings, those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and, at times, a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy, gadget-mad, hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb, a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately, memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition, with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue, and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire, his crestfallen son, and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy, adept, and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times, particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one, having such smart, savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather, which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through, one more dangerous than the last, provide the picture with a visual kick, and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow, but he does get solid performances from his cast, a rich and delectable production design from his art department, and swirling, hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences, it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers, this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience, after all). It is not a work of art, however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****"~7
Inception~10 November 2011~A dream inside a dream inside of my dreams....~"The reason I named this review the way I did is because I've fallen asleep watching this turd of a film so many times that I don't dare to count anymore, my brother unfortunately loves it so I'm forced to watch it. They shoulda paid me to come see this crap, because I want my money back.For starters,......a dream in a dream in a dream?.....you couldn't think of a better way to say that? It makes the complexity of an already complex movie even more so by adding demensions that I just do not give a flying crap about. When I go to see a movie, I don't like having to work to understand it. I didn't leave WORK early to come home, get dressed, and take my girl out to WORK, we came to see a movie. This movie will mind rape you, and in the end, the entire theater, (myself included) walking out afterwards scratching our heads and saying, ""what the eff just happened?""This movie did teach me something though,.....it taught me how to not get laid. She hated it, I hated it, no poon for me.So do yourselves a favor, don't listen to the idiot critics on this site, bc their too busy shooting up some black tar heroin to know what they are talking about.....because this movie is absolute trash. 3 stars was being nice"~0
Inception~22 July 2010~Extremely disappointed - This film is totally over-rated~Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down.~3
Inception~2 October 2010~It doesn't work - period~For a film of this kind to work there are (at the very least) three script-writing requirements: a) internal logic, b) characters with depth, and c) the complete omission of wise-a*s gimmickry.The film fails on all three counts.I liked the avalanche; I liked the freight train. I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train.~2
Inception~31 August 2010~What went wrong? Nolan was rather promising 10 years ago.~What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like 'the Cell' without the lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre.1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I've seen better in James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people who like to see things go 'bang' and no doubt play first-person shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don't propel the story forward a single inch.2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no spark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old flame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was alive.3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart the success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here, just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically he doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the moments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years?I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film certainly is not.~4
Inception~19 December 2020~Incredible movie~This movies is a masterpiece by one of he greatest directors Christopher Nolan. And he made it in some way that the twists and turns are the best of the best of the best. I also appreciate the actors in this movie. I especially liked DiCaprio, Tom Hardy , Gordon Levitt.? ~9
Inception~16 August 2010~A very sad case of Matrix-wannabe~Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as (sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble.It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie.Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance.~1
Inception~18 March 2011~Action movie overshadows concept~"Over the top special effects movie that overshadow the plot and interesting concept. Actually a very very simple plot. Visually excellent, if you are impressed with studio effects that you see in so many action movies. I guess.Simple plot line but complicated presentation that left me lost twice lost until about 10 minutes later. Then, ""I got it."" After one or two of those you get the hang of it. This is how the movie is structured – they tell you and then reinforce. Kindergarten for adults. It is all very clear but you have to pay attention The problem is the action scenes are over the top. How many snow chases have you seen? There are bad guys that can't shoot and good guys who seem to be wimps that beat the heck out of the soldiers and thugs. This isn't real life. How many times do we need to watch the fight scene in the hotel hallway? Why do they go on and on? Boy is this tedious! There is a lot of time and special effects used for a simple plot line.It's a ying and yang movie. I guess I would call it a cognition or attribution movie coupled with overly done, seen it before shoot it up scenes used to present what were interesting concepts. It is simple action movie and I think it could have been a thinker's movie."~3
Inception~17 July 2010~I'm sorry to say this is not as 'great' a film as they think~But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.~8
Inception~9 November 2010~Unique but not good~Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie!Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be.~5
Inception~4 September 2020~Why Inception Is No Masterpiece!~Over the past decade I've seen Christopher Nolan's Inception around 5 or 6 times now. I've seen it multiple times, because I feel I must be missing something when so many others claim this is his masterpiece, whilst I can honestly take it, or leave it. I've seen all of Nolan's work and while I believe he is a truly gifted and creative film- maker, I believe Inception is seriously over rated. Here's why.As with many of his movies, technically, it can't be faulted. It looks and sounds a treat and is filled with some great sequences, just like a movie such as The Matrix Reloaded. That had some terrifically filmed sequences too, but just like Inception, wasn't a great movie ... which reminds me. Those Nolan disciples who think Inception doesn't borrow heavily from ideas floated in The Matrix are just kidding themselves. Watch The Matrix (by far the best of its trilogy, just like Batman Begins is the best of its series), then watch Inception and you'll see what I mean.My main issue with Inception is the storyline and characterisations lack balance. It's a long movie (and after repeated viewings, I have to say the time doesn't skip by) with lots of relatively important support characters, who are required to flesh out the narrative yet the only ones we ever get to know are Cobb and (versions of anyway) Mal. And I have to say that by the end of the movie, I'm totally over knowing anything more about Cobb and Mal's (surely symbolic of Malware) generally toxic relationship.Arthur seems to have some sort of partner arrangement with Cobb. Yet, even in a two and a half hour feature, nothing is ever made really clear about it. It just seems to exist and Arthur just kind of magically does stuff. Same with Ariadne, a graduate student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. Where did she learn all these skills, that we never actually see her do (apart from scribble on a piece of note-paper, once or twice)? At university with Professor Miles? Same with Eames, who has some kind of mysterious ability to impersonate others, even going as far as talking like them, after he puts a bag over his head, then re-emerging to look and sound like Tom Berenger.I could go on, but I think most get the picture. If Quentin Tarantino had directed Inception we would have found out more about some of these intriguing support characters, because Quentin likes his support characters. In Inception we get zilch, except more and even more (at different sub-conscious levels) of Cobb's and Mal's seemingly never-ending story. (Like Ariadne, I 'd heard and seen enough well before the conclusion.)It's disappointing too, that for such a well produced film, Inception has too rely on some of the age old contrivances to get by. There's virtually no exposition on the extraction/inception technology that Cobb and Artur specialise in. How did they develop their skills? As always, the bad guys (or dream security protection individuals) can't shoot straight. A bunch of them with automatic weapons blast a vehicle nearly to pieces at point blank range and only Saito gets wounded? In a stair well scene later in the movie, Arthur is fired at (again with an automatic weapon) with multiple rounds from a few metres away and is left unscathed? Yusef's van, continually mega shot up and none of those sleeping people or Yusef hit? Just accept it, in the interest of supposedly brilliant film-making and move on.Inception is a multi-layered, technical marvel of a film, written and directed by a great film-maker, but this is definitely not Chris Nolan's finest cinematic moment. Inception isn't a dud but nor is it a masterpiece. It's like a very ambitious, overlong pulp fiction piece: visually beautiful, ingenious in parts and dragging in others. I'm amazed how how inconsistant the story feels to me, even after multiple viewings and how boring and poorly written, so many of the characters in the movie are depicted as being. It's almost enough to send me to sleep. I give it a 6.5 /10.~7
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~27 June 2002~All the fun of the original with a much better, darker plot~The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion. While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series. However what gets added to that is a much darker strand. The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact. This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion. In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company. The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett. The two work well together and come together well for a great finale. The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first. The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here. However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi. Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better. Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising. All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 April 2016~Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!~Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~16 January 2020~I enjoy this one more than A New Hope~So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~4 April 2023~One for All & All for One...~Yavin 4 had been discovered so they fled, three years later and it's Hoth where rebels tread, Luke Skywalker's on patrol, when a Wampa takes control, leaves him hanging in its cave to have with bread. He escapes into the blizzard and the cold, has a vision from a friend where he is told, seek to train from Master Yoda, find him on planet Dagobah, Han arrives, and slips him in a Tauntaun fold. A droid informs the Empire what it's found, leaves the rebels little time to hang around, first protect the energy field, that provides the bases shield, as off to Hoth, Imperial forces bound.It's a game of cat and mouse, as the rebels seek to avoid capture and Luke develops his Jedi skills while learning some pertinent family history but becomes a little less dexterous (for the time being).? ~8
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~7 October 2004~A worthy second (or 5th??) Star Wars installment, might be the best of the bunch.~My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~26 October 1999~It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature~`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.' I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn't matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~6 August 2002~Even though he wasn't at the director's helm this time, George Lucas has done it again.~In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~6 May 2016~Best Star Wars FILM~After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~29 November 2009~Manages to be even better than New Hope, and that was just as brilliant~The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~21 March 2022~This is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see~The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.This movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).The Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.Overall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see. This is an easy 10/10.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 December 2015~Fantastic Sequel~"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends?""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")"~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~2 May 2000~The best film in the original trilogy.~The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.? ~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~12 September 2010~Outstanding follow up.~Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor.Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience.Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway.ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along.Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made.Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~21 August 2018~Greatest Movie Ever~This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through. Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for. That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 December 2004~Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 March 2007~Why can't they make them like this any more?~From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~2 April 2002~One of the best movies of all!~The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!Note: The special edition has added scenes,special effects,sounds,and creatures. To ME the highlight of this special edition is seeing the Wampa monster!? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 June 2020~Star Wars Episode 5 Empire Strike Back~One of the best movies in Star Wars is a very interesting movie? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~7 July 2022~Possibly The Best~After the sensation that Star Wars was, it would seem impossible to make a worthy follow up but somehow Lucas and his team did. In fact, there's a strong argument to be made that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back even surpassed its predecessor and is the best of the franchise/hexalogy. While I may not propound that myself, I couldn't exactly reject it either. All I can add is it does contain the best cinematography of all the films, courtesy of Peter Suschitzky.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 July 2020~Masterpiece~A true masterpiece. in my opinion the best star wars movie.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~23 August 2005~Who's Your Daddy?~"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is."~8
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 November 2007~Best of the best~"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 September 2022~Top Tier Cinema~"What can I say about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that hasn't already been said? This film takes everything great about ""A New Hope"" and elevates it. The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in ""Empire"". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance.This movie shows that the ""galaxy far, far away"" is more than just Tatooine and the Death Star. From Hoth to Dagpbah to Cloud City, ""Empire"" helps expand the Star Wars Universe. By traveling to different parts of the galaxy, the film physically separates the three leads. Even though apart, their connection remains strong with the force (and their incredible chemistry) binding them together. Their individual journeys have purpose and the addition of new supporting characters (Yoda, Lando, etc.) are legendary.If this film failed, Star Wars would not be the legendary franchise that it is today. Simply put, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is top tier cinema.Additional Note: The three ""chill-worthy"" moments were 1. Yoda raising the ship. 2. THE reveal. 3. Realizing the force connection between the siblings."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~12 December 2021~My Favourite Film Ever~So my next step in watching Star Wars films is the 2nd film released The Empire Strikes Back and I'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film I have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.Main Character There is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.Supporting Characters As mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.Story This film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.Script The script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.Style This film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.Overall Overall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.Rating - 10/10.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 November 2019~Best of the three~Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~28 October 2022~Even though my review will be lost in the mass of others, I have to voice my opinion of how much a classic this is~This is the epitome of sci-fi movie making. It's a classic, a tale that thrusts the audience into a world completely unlike their own. We love it not just for the famous twist, not just for the cultural impact it has and had on society, but simply for the story and the ground-breaking special effects, one should easily be able to see how much of an achievement this film is.It's a gripping sequel to the story that started it all. It's starts off of a cliffhanger, and ends with an even bigger one, leaving the audience wanting more. I only wish I could travel back in time to see it in theaters when it was first released.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~18 September 2023~One of the best films ever made.~Luke Skywalker goes in search of Jedi Master Yoda, to begin his Jedi training, meanwhile his friends and fellow band of rebels are pursued by The Empire's forces.How on Earth was it possible to match, if not surpass Episode IV, it seems unfathomable, well that's exactly what they did with this remarkable movie, and whilst I personally rank the films on par with one another, I get why some favour this one. For me, the first came out of nowhere, whereas for this second one, expectations would have been incredibly high.A superb storyline, breathtaking visuals, first class acting, and Yoda, what more could anyone possibly want or need from a movie, it's a bold claim, but I would genuinely say this is one of the greatest films of all time.The sets are unbelievable, you can really tell that for those involved this was definitely a labour of love, everything was precise and on point.It's worth a 10/10 for Yoda alone, I adore his and Luke's scenes together. The wonderful voice of Frank Oz adds a great deal, it really does help to make Yoda such an amazing, funny, smart and curious character.Let's be honest, films don't get much better than this, it really is a masterpiece.10/10.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 September 1998~My 8th favorite film of all time!~This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 March 2022~Easily One of the Best Films Ever Made~This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.Each character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.The sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.Which brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.I feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*I like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun. Revenge of the Sith is my favorite, easily.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~27 May 2007~Well Done. One of the best sci-fi films ever. It almost equals the 1977 original in terms of quality and popularity.~"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~19 February 2019~still the best star wars movie ever made~And one of the best movies in general, it's better than a new hope in every way possible and it's one of the strongest sequels in the cinema.the scenes with luke and yoda are some of the best in the saga and yoda's way of teaching luke is really beautiful, it's as much as a master apprentice as it can get.and my god that third act is just iconic and the ending is so magical, peaceful and sad at the same time.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~23 July 2022~The sequel to the groundbreaking Star Wars revisits everything that worked the first time while upping the stakes and refining the rough spots.~"Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.George Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.From the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called ""Walkers"" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader ""promoting"" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.The Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time. The characters you loved the first time around are expanded upon and revisited and the world is made to feel alive and bigger with new environments and world building that make the film an engaging sit even when you know what's coming."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~12 December 2019~A proposed alternate subtitle: The Humiliation of Luke Skywalker.~"There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from ""Faster, more intense"" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 May 2022~Definitely one of the greatest movies of all time~It's really sad to see what star wars has become these days..unoriginal, uninspiring, lacking passion..I can go on and on and on but I just don't have the stomach for it anymore..but this movie right here, star wars empire strikes back, is just so masterfully inspiring and masterfully done. The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that. Give it a shot...you won't be disappointed.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 December 2019~Even better than the original~Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a more mature, unpredictable sequel that continues to expand the universe and is overall even better than the original, as one of the greatest sequels of all time. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher are all incredible. James Earl Jones is even better as a more threatening and ruthless Darth Vader and Frank Oz is excellent as Yoda. Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again. It's expertly paced and Irvin Kershner's direction is incredible. The action sequences are extremely thrilling and it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise so far, in my opinion. It also has one the greatest twists of all time.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~14 November 2017~An Honest Review~"So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.OK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.Now, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.But then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.I'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.Now, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.For starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.We could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.Empire had that.And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.Moving on...We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 August 2022~Even better than the first one!~Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).This has to be my favourite Star Wars movie out of them all! This movie does everything way better than the first with great character Development will all characters and the introduction of 2 new characters, a smuggler from Hans past and a badass bounty hunter. The most has great special effects and a great musical score by John Williams again! The sets are so good to look at and the characters are so much more likeable in this movie!The movie also becomes way more darker than the last one.Mark Hamill does a way better job playing Luke even becoming more likeable. Carrie Fisher is still the likeable princess from the first one. Harrison Ford is still as likeable from the first one and him and Leia relationship is way more drawn out. Chewbacca is hilarious in this movie. Billy Dee Williams is a welcomed addition to this movie! James Earl Jones is menacing Vader!Overall this is the best Star Wars movie to date!~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~15 February 2007~The Son~"The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things: a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 June 2006~Big Improvement Over The First Star Wars~"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better."~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 January 2020~The best of the original trilogy~"Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the original trilogy. I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: ""I'm your father"".Everything about this movie is better than A New Hope (and A New Hope was a 9/10 for me) including: the lightsaber battle, the special effects (which still hold up to an extent to this day), Yoda, a deeper dive into the universe through character and creature introductions, and of course more of Darth Vader. The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too. This movie is just a classic and absolutely my favorite movie out of all 9.Final grade: Absolutely a 10/? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 February 2020~Instant Fav -- best of the OG trilogy~"My hands-down favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy. The dark side has started seeking their revenge after the destruction of the Death Star and Luke trains to become the Jedi master that his father once was.Enjoyed the higher budget compared to the first Star Wars movie and how the Empire actually wins a few battles this time. Makes the whole ""galactic war"" seem more real.5/5. I'm sure the other fanboys have more extensive movie reviews for those who are interested.? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~19 December 2013~"""Still is the best sequel of all time"""~I remember to see this movie with my father(R.I.P)in theaters and in that time you don't know nothing about the movie is not like this times that you have magazinez and web to know everything about the movie so i was in 0 when i got to see it.Of course i see STAR WARS about 7 u 8 times and i was amazing when i see this movie i was open mouth..so dark so mysterius so thriller so tragic i mean everything in this movie was perfect.I can't believe that is almost 35 years of this movie and still looks great with new effects o not look's great!!!.That's why all the fans of SW knows that this is the best movie of the saga and simply one of the best sequels ever make in movie story!!!.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 December 2019~My favourite Star Wars film~I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 July 2022~Flawless.........~So good. Star Wars A New Hope was amazing when it came out. So the hype around The Empire Strikes Back was huge. But wow, this film was awesome. The film did everything that made the first film great and added with it. From the iconic twist, to introducing new characters such as Bobba Fett, Lando Calrissian and the other bounty hunters. It added on so many new things and it worked great. Overall this is a classic film that everyone should watch, Star Wars fan or not, the original trilogy is a must watch for everyone.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~28 May 2022~Perfect Star Wars Film in an Imperfect Saga~The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~19 February 2019~Star Wars at its best~Some films you love because you can't separate your childhood from your view, but this is as good as popcorn entertainment gets either way. I've watched and watched and now my son loves, if only you can get hold of the untinkered version it's just brilliant.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~15 February 2022~Maybe the Best of Them All~Every time I revisit the good old first trilogy I wonder: did Georg Lucas spend all this creativity on the first three movies or did he have some ghost writer or maybe he got the story dictated by a supernatural being? Without any doubt, those three first movies of the ST franchise are still and maybe for all eternity gems and milestones to the sci-fi genre, but almost everything else that was produced and published after Return of the Jedi is in comparison bad, really bad, with a very few exceptions (Rogue One was good). But maybe the saying even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn just fits too well to Mr. Lucas. Anyway, he gave us these three epic movies, and for these treasures I am grateful in all eternity, and the rest I can just ignore. Amen.? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~29 May 2016~The saga thickens and matures~"This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the ""March of Darth Vader"" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself. Oscar winner for Best Sound, is one of the most popular films of the saga in the present day."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~8 May 2020~Awesome~(5 out of 5 stars).Great second movie in the trilogy. Darker. The opening battle on a snowy planet was awesome. The lightsaber battle with Vader and Luke was great. Plus a twist. The script and direction is great. The cast is great.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~26 May 2023~"""Laugh it up fuzzball!"""~"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -Before I start the review of this film I will state that I do love it, because I love all of the Star Wars universe, especially the original trilogy, but also because it was a really well made film and it was delivered excellently in the same way as the first.I may ramble and reminisce a bit too much at times, not there should be some sort of point to it and actually that's the affect that these films have on a lot of people.This film didn't fall in to the usual trap of a sequel, with repetition and pointless continuation just for the sake of making money. It had some great moments, including laughs, action, space fighting, romance, the whole lot and with an original plot that continued the story because it needed to.I wouldn't have liked to have turned up to it without having seen 'Star Wars' (1977) beforehand and if you have to finish things off due to some sort of O. C. D., like I do, you will need to watch the next one, 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' (1983) too, because this one ends on a cliffhanger.It works as Episode ""V"" of the original 3 (V, IV & VI - Ask George) and of the larger nonet that it became with the release of the Prequel Trilogy (1999/2002/2005?) and the more recent Sequels (2015/2017/2019) too and many regard it very highly on its own, but it certainly couldn't have been released or have been so successful without Episode IV, because I needed to know where they came from, who Ben was, why Luke had magic powers and so on.With that aside, I think that I mostly tend to appreciate this film, because I only remember seeing ""IV"" and ""VI"" on TV as a child, with maybe a few clips of this one, until my parents finally got a Video Cassette Player and of course the all important Cassettes to go with it, which came quite a bit later due to these highly popular productions actually being quite expensive back then.As a result I probably haven't seen this one as often as the other two, but feel a nostalgia based on a clearer teenage mind watching it almost new, as opposed to a 7 year old's memories of cute Teddy Bears (Ewoks) for instance.The story and the character development was great, because it meant that there was more of the universe that I already loved and I got to know my favourites better, whilst other great personalities like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (Frank Oz) were introduced.""Empire"" actually had some of the better jokes, a great story and many of the classic moments that have since been turned in to memes. Harrison Ford looked mighty fine as Han Solo too.The update of the film, when it was digitally remastered, added some beautiful colours to places like Cloud City and clarity for the rest of the film. I also finally got to see more clearly what it was that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film, which, fun fact, was written in because of a car accident that he had in between recording, which left his face quite hideously disfigured.I also thought that they had realised that Harry had given them a lot more than they had expected in the first film and they seemed to have decided to expand his role in this one to make him more than just a roguish taxi driver. They later did the same, quite cleverly, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in the sequel films, because although the Jedi bit is great, the films have always relied on these additional characters to keep the action going in other ways while the young Padawan gets trained or has extended laser sword fights.The brilliance of this instalment was also added to by yet another superb soundtrack provided by John Williams, who managed to almost completely create something new, on top of the existing themes, but without it being far far away from the general style of sound already used.As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with any of the Star Wars films (Skip 'The Last Jedi' - 2017), because they contain so much heart and a vast knowledge of the film history that had been collated in George Lucas' mind while he grew up. That was obvious with nods to many of the other great epic western, medieval, sci-fi and war films and tales that went before and of course the polish he delivered with each of the films in this series, not to forget the brilliance that came from his own imagination and the superb supporting special effects created by the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) studios.I look at other films from the late 70's and early 80's and wonder why they didn't put as much in to it as the people that made this original trilogy, because it obviously worked if you want to create something that lasted.962.22/1000."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 November 2019~The Empire Strikes Back~This is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie yet. It improves upon the first movie and has the one of the best plot twist of all time. Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.9.5/? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~27 May 2005~The darkest and best of the original trilogy~One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny.~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~19 December 2015~A Bigger and To Some Better Sequel~"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)**** (out of 4)The second film of the original trilogy has the Empire forcing their vengeance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) begins his Jedi training with Yoda while Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca and the gang try to get to Darth Vadar.George Lucas directed the original STAR WARS in 1977, which was a tremendous hit with both fans and critics. He basically took a ""B"" movie idea, something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie, I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers, director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger, more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects, a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus, it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that."~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~18 October 2017~My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!~"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ ""No, I am your father!"" (Vader to Luke) ""Try not, Do, or do not!"" (Yoda to Luke)"~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 June 2022~This film was released wide in the USA on June 20th, 1980~Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.George Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City. The stage is set for one of the biggest cliff-hangers in film history.9.3 (A Mygrade) = 9 IMDB.~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 April 2023~The Evolution & Expansion of Star Wars~Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.Some of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.Empire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.Relationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.Once again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.The soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well. Overall, the whole film is a little more seamless, and it is the perfect film building upon an unbeatable foundation.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~23 January 2005~Darker, more fluid advancement in the story line but not necessarily better~"George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""Jedi Knight"".'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible."~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~14 April 2006~The Best Star Wars and One of the Best Films Ever Made~It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~5 December 2012~A Timeless Space Opera, The Perfect Sci-Fi Epic~Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~8 June 2005~The most highly anticipated sequel of all time~"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 June 2023~Cinema Personified: Brilliant Movie~Rating: 9.7 Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 June 2014~Entertaining~Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit.~7

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~18 March 2008~A Return to Innocence~"Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously ""Star Wars"", but when you put them together, in this order, the words ""Empire Strikes Back"" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, ""I can give it a try""  we all know, by heart, what will follow next.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine  get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. ""Empire Strikes Back"" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, ""Empire Strikes Back"" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in ""Return of the Jedi"", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, ""Empire"" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous ""Who shot J.R.?"" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; ""Star Wars"" is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the ""new"" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form.Without sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****"~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 December 2019~the best film~The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 November 2021~The Star Wars Goat~The gold standard of Star Wars films, Empire outdoes ANH on every level with a deeper look at the characters, superior acting, special effects and story. The only film in the franchise without a giant finale, Empire transcended blockbuster movie making with Irvin Kerschner showing George how these movies should be done. The Michael Jordan of Star Wars. 10/10.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 September 2015~An Original Blockbuster~The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.Thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.This film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.Featured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast.~7
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~4 October 2005~I guess that the Force will be with the original series forever!~"I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that ""Return of the Jedi"" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~11 March 2017~"Action, Adventure, But Lack Of ""Epic"""~"In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor.In ""Episode V"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""Empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas ""New Hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""Empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original."~7
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 April 2007~One of the worthiest sequels of all time~STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~26 October 2009~Slightly better than the Original~The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie:Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a cliché plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. Everything about it is just perfect.Final rating : 10/10-PeterPPK~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 January 2020~Possibly the Greatest Sequel in Cinema History~This film is just pure awesome, for kids, adults, and everyone in between.Anyone can watch it and get something out of it; for the kids it's the cool worlds and weird-looking creatures, for teens, it's all the cool explosions and action scenes, and adults can enjoy all the character development and darker themes this movie has to offer.This really is a magical movie.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~23 January 1999~Best of the trilogy - one of the best movies ever.~"Hoth is great - asteroids are great - space slug is great - Yoda is one of the best original characters ever in a movie - Vader is a real bastard - Lando ""colt 45"" Calrissian and Boba ""he's no good to me dead"" Fett take charge of cloud city -- Leia and Han fall in love - Luke gets all sweaty during the training - best lightsaber duel of the three flicks -- ""how you doin' chewbacca, still hanging around with this loser?"" -- 3po gets shot and r2 saves the day at least three times again -- THIS MOVIE IS THE REASON LIFE CAN BE SO GRAND - the trilogy has given me and many others endless hours of happiness. A gem. 10 out of 10.? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~7 April 2010~The Way Star Wars Was Meant To Be~"Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.In your epic battles of good and evil, ""Empire Strikes Back"" pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become cliché to compare ""Star Wars"" to ""Lord of the Rings"", and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, ""Star Wars"" is better and ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the best.As Dante Hicks says in ""Clerks"", this film is the best because it imitates life, ""a series of down endings"". Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed. That's what makes this fantasy very much reality."~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 November 2019~Top 5 movie of all time~Another genius episode by George Lucas. Fantastic story, f/x and cimedy. This has it all.Maybe the best of them all.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 July 2022~Would Not Work Alone~This movie is really good, obviously the best star wars movie. But it would not be has good has it is if the other star wars movies did not exist. Star Wars episode 4 helped a lot by introducing the characters and the universe. The drama is great, the acting was ok, the character developement is awsome, the fight scenes are ok and the rest is really well done. For sure Star Wars episode 4 was essential to the sucess of this film, but it still has to be recognized for how good it is.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~14 December 2008~Maybe even better than original~I'm not sure which part I liked more - this one or the original. But this part sure is better in some terms. Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 May 2020~The best movie in an overrated franchise~40 years later and Disney with all of it billions of dollars still can't make a Star Wars film that comes close to this.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 November 2018~Best.Movie.Ever~"Wow, what a film, I never knew that I could love a film soooo much in my life, but here it is, my favourite film of all time, the one that made me love Star Wars. First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10. Perfection.? "~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~7 January 2009~Difficult to see all the fuss and love nowadays as much as those present for its inauguration did.~Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time.~6
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 July 2013~The standout film in the series so far.~"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10."~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 October 2005~This is it!!~"If the first Star Wars (1977) was groundbreaking, this one is breathtaking! According to me at least - the best picture in film history! A culminated crown-jewel after a decade of excellent drama productions, such as The Godfather I & II, one flew over the cuckoo's nest etc, etc. Everything is there.. skillful focus on the character-arch.. a relaxed and charming love story.. fantastic action and heroism.. and above all- George Lucas story! What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!! The themes and their crafted development to the story context.. wow.. Why he didn't get the academy award, still remains one of the biggest mysteries to me, up to this day.. If you find yourself crying, getting goosebumps and laughing at the same time when viewing this piece, don't worry- You're not alone...The force is strong with this one!!? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~1 February 2021~It's Star Wars, you know how good it is~"The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level. The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would. The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism. It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come. Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total. For some reason I prefer A New Hope? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~7 August 2022~Incredibles~An amazing sequel my dad loves and I mean love's this movie I think it is pretty good but I don't think it's as good as a new Hope new Hope is a classic but still a really good movie.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~15 June 2023~Better than the first~"(1980) The Empire Strikes Back SCIENCE-FICTION ACTION ADVENTUREA continuation from mega hit ""Star Wars"" and the best one of the series so far for it's dark tones, but with a different director Irwin Kershner at the helm, and taking some rather liberated direction unexpected to happen for a space film. Continuing the adventures with Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo as well as the rest of the cast to defeat Darth Vader's dark alliance. Muppet character created by Frank Oz ""Yoda"" was a delight, and it's finally nice to see an ethnicity to have an appearance, an African actor Billy Dee Williams playing Lando from a cast dominated by an all white cast. Visually stunning with a twist unheard of for a rather superficial Star Wars movie.? "~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 November 2019~Everything a Classic should be!~Epiaode IV - A New Hope is 10 out of 10. Certainly, I would love to give Episode V more than 10. This is great movie with great twists and turns. This is everything a classic should be.Luke v Vader... this was awaited most certainly and I loved the portrayed and the conclusion of this fight. Empire really striking back and even nice men are foeced to betray their friends.From beginning til end the whole concept of story grips you tightly and sharp turns on this journey gives the varieties of emotions. Simply a movie to remember and to talk and encourage others to watch. Gold.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~23 July 2020~Wars not make one great~The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride.The best praise I can give The Empire Strikes Back is that it was the first Star Wars movie to hold my 3 year old daughter's attention for the entire duration, and it's easy to see why as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story.Several great characters are introduced such as Yoda, Lando, Boba Fett, and the Emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movies favourites of Han, Chewie, Leia, Luke, Darth Vader, and the droids continue to entertain.There are countless cinematic moments such as the Hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between Han and Leia, and virtually everything that happens on Degaba and in the Cloud City. The classic scene with Luke and Vader is so atmospheric and dramatic you will be hard pressed not to find yourself role-playing it with your own children one day.John Williams is the true star of the show as his music fits the emotion of every scene perfectly. I still catch my daughter humming the Imperial March to herself from time to time.Visually it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with groundbreaking (for the time) effects, excellent cinematography, editing, action sequences, puppetry, sets, costumes and battles. Likewise the sound effects are wonderful.The performances include memorable turns from James Earl Jones, Frank Oz, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels.Some consider it to be superior to the original Star Wars (A New Hope) and they may well have a point. It is darker, more intriguing, delivers an excellent twist, and ends on the edge of a cliff. However, the spectacle didn't awe me on the same level as the original. This is not fault of the sequel, as it simply came second, and much like a junkie chasing their first high I never quite achieved the same feeling.(This review is for the original theatrical release and not the special edition)~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~22 August 2021~What a Twist . . .~I didn't watch this movie when I was a kid.It is quite normal not to know about this film in Azerbaijan, which used to be a part of the Soviet Union. Yes, I admit, I watched this movie during my university years. Many young people now watch and love Star Wars movies, which is very pleasing to see. Even though I watched this movie very late, I liked it very much. Wonderful !? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~9 January 2023~Best of the Star Wars Films - The Empire Strikes Back~The first three installments of the Star Wars series of films are easily the best three of the entire series; and this film, The Empire Strikes Back, is the best of the top three. If for no other reason, the development and dramatic impact of the Darth Vader character within this film sets it apart from all the others. When Vader utters those famous five words in a battle scene, we remember them for the rest of our lives. The intensity of this film is greater than the first or third one (and far more than the latter entries). Not one, but a trio of characters, are fleshed out in this film more than in any other Star Wars entry. Obiwan, Luke, and Vader all have great character development. The music is outstanding, the cinematography is outrageously good, and the script is more sophisticated than the first entry. Don't miss the best of the Stars Wars films.What idiots thought that Pulp Fiction or Fight Club were better films than this one? There are probably 99 out of 100 people who think this film is better.? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 September 2021~Legendary~The best Star Wars film in the saga no doubt and the greatest Sci-fi movie ever. This movie is absolutely legendary. Brilliant cinematography (the framing is flawless), great special effects and sound, unforgettable scenes, an outstanding score, some of the most iconic characters in movie history which are really allowed to develop in this film, the best and the most shocking plot twist in cinema history and an amazing storyline.The Empire Strikes Back is the definitive sci-fi movie and arguably the greatest achievements in cinema history. The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite movie of all time.10/10.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~4 August 2020~Excellent follow-up~This film continues the first Star Wars film in a way that really expands on the world without overshadowing its predecessor. It is worth it just for the famous plot twist that really defines the series. The Empire Strikes Back is even more thrilling and intense.? ~8
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~28 April 2019~Perfection~To this day, this remains my favorite Star Wars movie, from a story point of view, the villains taking order for the first time in a while, and after 39 years, I still think it will be hard to be topped by reboots or remakes.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~15 October 2021~Amazing~Takes the first Star Wars and improves literally everything- many of the shortcomings of that first film are either outright fixed or at least made less noticeable.Special effects are significantly improved (less CGI additions in the bluray version, too. And if they are there, they're generally less noticeable)Bigger and more ambitious action scenesPacing is just flawlessDialogue is sharper; the banter between characters is much betterIt's better shot from a visual standpoint, too. The first Star Wars had plenty of iconic images for sure, but this one just feels more cinematic, with better camerawork, lighting, and use of colour.This is absolutely a near masterpiece that's hard to fault to be honest... but you didn't need my ramblings to tell you that.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~11 July 2022~Very nice~Second chapter that can be defined as a transition between the first and the last, is a chapter full of plot but in any case of passage, useful only for the construction of the final phase of the saga.? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~9 July 2023~Stupendous film on all the fronts!!~The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) is an epic space opera film directed by Late Irvin Kershner. The film stars an ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Late Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, Late David Prowse, Late Kenny Baker, Late Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.Darth Vader is adamant about turning Luke Skywalker to the dark side. Master Yoda trains Luke to become a Jedi Knight while his friends try to fend off the Imperial fleet.What a superb follow up of the first part of the original trilogy and an outstanding film on all the fronts, be it it's plot, it's execution, acting, screenplay or BGM the film never disappoints on any front. The film is also one of the rarest phenomena in the history of cinema in which the second part is better then first part. Finding a fault in this film is very difficult. With so many reviews of this film it's very difficult to find new word in the appreciation of this fantastic film.This is an amazing film and sets up superb foundation for the third and final part of the original trilogy a must must watch.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 January 2014~I am your father~In my opinion this is not only better than the first film or the fourth whatever but it is the best in the entire franchise. I loved it from the first minute until the last, I love star wars even since I was about 4 years old and I used to hate this movie but when I watch it now it's just amazing. Also in this film great Star Wars characters make their debut with the likes of Yoda and Orlnado Calrizion (if that is how you spell it and I can't remember if it is Orlando and Lando so excuse me if I got it wrong.)This film starred Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford & Carrie FisherI highly recommend this film to all you sci-fi fans****/***** not outstanding but very good? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 January 2008~Probably better than Star Wars~Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 August 2018~Trouble with the truth~This movie takes place after A new hope.In this movie Luke meets the trial of his life when he faces off against Darth Vader and he learns the truth about who he is, who actually is Leia and what happens to the Jedi.Well I am not too much of an expert on this Star Wars movie so I am sorry this is not much in detail. However, we are introduced to Lando and this is the only time Boba Fett talks.If you liked A New Hope you will enjoy this classic as well.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 April 2022~Empire Strikes Back Is Truly A Striking Sequel That Mostly Fascinating~Empire Strikes Back got way more to offer in terms of a story, character, and performances, it's an epic journey with a more clever and exciting continuation, nit picky was still there like A New Hope at least for me, i think Han Solo and Princess Leia relationship was a bit too much and too in depth later in the movie, i mean i like the first couple of them, but overall still Empire Strikes Back is truly a striking sequel that mostly fascinating, it's still an incredible sequel.? ~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 October 2003~The greatest sequel of all time~This is how sequels should always be done. Higher budget. Preplanned story arc. And memorable dialogue. The best sequel ever made hands down. In many ways this film is even better than its predecessor. But, unfortunately, because it doesn't stand so well on its own, it will always be considered the second best Star Wars movie.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 November 2018~All time favourite!~I love this episode of the series. It's a fun comfortable watch for me and I enjoy everything about it.My only wish is that I could watch the original trilogy again without the added F/X and remastering.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~22 July 2020~Simply the Best and Endlessly Rewatchable~First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible.With Irvin Kershner taking the reigns of director, from George Lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean. However, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue.The visual effects of the 1977 release of Star Wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. Whether this be the representation of Cloud City, the Walker Assault or even as simple as shots of the Falcon flying. These may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. I am simply gutted I wasn't able to experience that wonder myself.John Williams again excels at what he does. He is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. He truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons Star Wars, Empire especially, is still so loved today.Empire Strikes Back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality. The Story is unforgettable and the film-making is sublime. I only have two words for those involved in its production: Thank You!~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 December 2021~"""impressive, most impressive"""~I love this movie so incredibly much it's so nostalgic for me watching it as a kid but even excluding that this movie is an apsalute gem giving us tonnes of memorable characters and lines that have been so iconic. The movie is iconic with sets and props that have inspired to many other science fiction movies and movies in general for years to come.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~25 December 2019~Favorite movie of all times~An amazing film with an amazing story written by an amazing guy that we all love? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~24 September 2010~Exile To Hoth~Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away.And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas.~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~18 January 2019~The one story every later filmmaker takes inspiration from.~I can't say anything new to this massive spectacle of a movie. Everything has already been said, but I can share my personal expirience with you and it was epic, grand, exciting and every positive adjective you could think of!For too long I had gone without watching the original Star Wars trilogy, because reasons unknown, but when I finally sat down and put it on so much felt familiar. Not in a bad way, because I see it like it has made such a huge impact on pop culture that everybody knows Darth Vader is and qoutes the movie's lines and so much more! I hadn't seen it as I said, but it still felt exciting watching every move they made and listening to the magnificent score by John Williams! The big reveal was still epic even though I knew it from people talking about it and saying the famous line.The story structure and the surprise reveal of something to completely change our hero's view on everything he thought he knew has been done so many times after The Empire Strikes Back wrecked theaters and became a phenomenon, so it definitely is the most impactful of all Star Wars films.Everyone tries to make a phenomenal movie, but only few ends up like The Empire Strikes Back!~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~28 December 2020~One of THE best sequels ever made~Forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. A sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone.Every top best sequels I see always has Empire Strikes Back on the number one spot, and there's a reason why. It took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film.If I have to pick where to put this on my Star Wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots.The romance part of the film works really well with Leia and Han. Sure, the age gap between Carrie and Harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever.The reveal of Vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when I first watched it, because I started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening.And I know this is going to cause a debate, but I think Yoda is a Muppet. It's not because of Frank Oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. I feel like the Jim Henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of Muppet Show where Luke, Chewie, R2 and 3PO was in and to me, that was a deal that Lucas and Henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. There's even some behind the scenes pictures that Jim, Kermit and Piggy were in. Think about that for a few minutes.This is without a doubt, one of the best sequels that was ever made and will always be forever. The force has always been strong with the franchise and fandom, and will forever more.~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 September 2018~"Best film in the saga ""Star Wars"""~The best movie in the Star Wars saga so far, one of the best movies ever. Improved soundtrack, more interesting story, better special effects, and a fantastic casting. Highly recommend.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~8 February 2019~Masterful~Hands down the best Star Wars movie to date. It's cross between adventure, pulling heartstring , plot, acting , etc is peerless in the sW saga? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~15 January 2006~I love this one!~This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best movies that has ever been made.Star Wars was a great movie, and a sequel being better then it seemed impossible, but empire strikes back is a better movie with a lot of good stuff.The special effects are still good today and the story is pretty good, i love a lot things that this movie has that star wars didn't.Like a lot better fight scenes, and they show a lot more of places and planets then the 1st one.I was very pleased with this movie and think it is a great film for a true movie fan to watch, i disagree with a lot of people who say it is the best star wars movie.But i can understand why they say it, empire has a lot of things to it that are just well done and impressive.I think this movie is worth owning and is a movie you can watch many times.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~28 January 2021~In the top 10 best movies ever made~A masterpiece....difficult to improve on A New Hope yet it does....very rarely watch a movie more than once...,,amongst those exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia, Blade Runner and a New Hope (around 5 times each).....and then, The Empire Strikes Back, 21 times.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~22 October 2021~Good Story, Great Action... Unfortunate Pace...~The momentum throughout the largely-adored Star Wars instalment isn't exactly energetic enough to win against A New Hope. So overall, it's a very well-constructed sequel that continues with the epic sci-fi action, but is mainly disappointing.The new director, Irvin Kershner, definitely builds onto George Lucas's original and clever direction. The force, the explosive effects, the appealing battles and the cool robots are all brought back, except they're not as fascinating this time... The real flaw is the exceedingly unhurried pace, and it manages to coat all the creativity.Although The Empire Strikes Back leaves off with a reasonably satisfying touch, it fails to leave you excited for the next movie. It's a likeable flick worth experiencing in the cinema, but it's adored a little too highly. But still, there's absolutely no doubt that the big fans of the series will love it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.~6
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~30 October 1998~Wow! What a follow up!~"After the success of Star Wars you would think that it can't get any better. Well it did. Empire is much more ambitious than the first one, and it shows. The story is more involved, it carries the story arcs from the first one over flawlessly. The Battle of Hoth is amazing to watch, as is the asteroid chase. Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader. Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other. Yoda's philosophy of ""do or do not."" are words to live by. Throw in the smooth talking Lando and a light saber duel that is truly exciting and you got yourself one hell of a follow up to one of the greatest films of all time. All that and finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father!? "~0
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 July 2013~It's Good But Is It Really That Great ?~"A conjunction is a word linking two sentences . A couple of examples of a conjunction is "" and "" and "" also "" so when I say THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good film then I also have to use the conjunction "" but "" in case I suffer an internet disembowelment on the grounds of blasphemy or heresyTwo things the film does well is spectacle and character interaction . The film gets off to a great start where the rebel forces on the Planet Hoth have to fight a battle against The Imperial Empire who are attacking the base using giant robotic camels . That alone makes it worth seeing and we get some smart liners between Han Solo and Princess lela and we get some smooth patter from Lando who gives a masterclass in how to impress a womanBut ( There's always a conjunction )most of the spectacle is confined to the first half of the film and after that the story concentrates on all the spiritual nonsense involving the force between Yoda and Luke Skywalker . Some people may be surprised that Mark Hamill's career as a movie star didn't take off but one wonders why he was cast in the franchise in the first place since he makes a rather wet unlikely hero rather than the youthful everyman the role is written as . Watching Hamill try and carry his scenes shows how unimpressive he is and how good the rest of the cast are in comparisonTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good Summer blockbuster but the brutal truth is that it's no more than that . It was made in an era before CGI dominated spectacular FX driven films at the turn of the century and that alone makes it worth seeing even if the most impressive scenes happen in the first half . But ( There's always a conjunction ) it's ridiculous the film is so highly rated on this site's top 250 movies and at best probably belongs in the lower reaches of the chart"~7
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~12 October 2007~The Empire Strikes Out~"The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make.? "~7
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~21 July 2022~The Retaliatory move of Darth Vader and the Empire~"""New Hope"" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.The very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.The main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.Leia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a ""twist"". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.However, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.The creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.The creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.""The Empire strikes back"" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the ""E"" for these heroes.9 out of 10."~9
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~11 December 2020~The best...~This has everything in the first movie - the visuals, story etc. BUT. It has loads and loads of plot twists, which makes the movie so, so interesting. Almost everyone would agree that it's the best Star Wars movie. Go watch it. Now.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~13 November 2004~Unlike Father & Son~"Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film.Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better.Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, ""I know."" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy.The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.10"~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~12 December 2022~The Peak of Star Wars~Trilling, excitement adventure. Yep this is what many consider to be the best Star Wars film and it's not hard to see why. Not just a great movie but an amazing sequel. Filled a great cast of Heroes and Villains. The effects 45 years later are still pretty amazing with amazing sets and puppetry work by Frank Oz, an amazing opening scene with tons of action and an ending that ends bitter sweet yet somber. Not to mention one of the best movie twist in history, with of course the only huge issue with the twist is even non Star Wars fans know what it is due to pop culture but that's basically a testament to how great it is.? ~10

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 September 2021~2nd favourite film~Just looked at other reviews. Not much more can be said. It's a 10/10 from me.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~5 December 2021~Star wars originals #2: the empire strikes back~Whenever I call a movie a perfect sequel, I usually say it's also an imperfect movie, the empire strikes back would be one of the first examples I would give out, I do think that it kind of has a slow start and some of the C-3PO stuff is unnecessary. But that doesn't bring down the fact that it's one of the best sequels of all time and of my personal favorite star wars movies, everything that happens after this revolves around the twist in this movie, and then they made the prequels and revenge of the sith explains everything, I prefer the empire strikes back over revenge of the sith as a sequel, but as a movie, I prefer revenge of the sith, this movie also has a lot heart and stakes. So it's not perfect but it's still great.? ~8
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 December 2004~The Saga Continues...~"It's very rare when a sequel outshines the film that came before it,""The Empire Strikes Back"" manages to do that in many ways. ""Star Wars"" always will be considered an all time classic,but ""Empire"" is a great follow up.According to George Lucas,It's ""Episode V"" in his space opera. In my opinion it's the best in the series.The characters are more fleshed out this time,and the plot is more complex and darker then the previous installment. The F/X is outstanding.The film stands on it's own as a great cinematic achievement and should be recognized as more than a sequel,It's a continuation of great epic and all around excellent film.? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 August 2006~Revenge is Sweet~"This, is one of those times where it's great when the bad guys win. I had grown up watching old westerns and kiddie movies, where it was all good guys win at the end. And when I first saw this when the Original (Best) Trilogy reopened in theaters, my parents rushed me to the nearest cinema. I was astounded. Great acting. Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made.It's only better because ""Star Wars"" set this one up perfectly. And it allowed a suspenseful ""Return of the Jedi"", which needed all it could get, because it was the worst of the Original's, but still pretty darn good. Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line.? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~4 February 2000~One of the Best Films Ever Made!~This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever). The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first. Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch. And it is actually quite good. With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience.? ~10

The groundbreaking visual effects and stunning set designs transport us to the frozen planet of Hoth, the lush swamps of Dagobah, and the magnificent Cloud City of Bespin. The Battle of Hoth alone is a masterpiece, showcasing the epic scope of the Star Wars universe and leaving audiences in awe of its grandeur.Furthermore, the film's screenplay, penned by the legendary Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, is a triumph.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~17 January 2016~Iconic~"By far my favorite Star Wars movie. Contains the iconic parts of the saga, for example the reveal of Darth Vader. The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city.? "~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~10 June 2005~Probably one of the most influential movies on my life~ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels).~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~6 April 2013~Star Wars does it again~This film is for SciFi fans. The film is for everyone 7 and older who love SciFi. The film has plenty of action to keep you in your seats. Luke Skywalker undergoes both Jedi training and we see his character develop from the rash young man he was in Star Wars IV. We also begin to see a hint into Darth Vader. I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter. However, it is very enjoyable and keeps the Star Wars saga going. Not only do I want more, a continuing story; but I want a beginning. Little did I know that all I had to do was wait a few years. If your are a Star Wars fan, be sure to include this one in your collection.? ~6

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~20 February 2021~Behold the Legend Itself~This film is so great. It works on so many levels and the best sequel of all time. Who doesn't love this movie if is well shot, great characters and everything is just 10 times better than the original. Star Wars is still to this day one of the greatest films ever made and I didn't think it could get better. I was wrong.? ~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~3 August 2009~The Most Powerful Star Wars Movie~The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation.This time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.We are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.But it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10~10
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back~2 November 2003~Best of the Star Wars Movies.~Empire Strikes Back is not only a great sequel to one of the best science Fiction movies ever made but its probably one of the best sequels ever made. A movie that not only blows away the first film in terms of scoop and magnitude but in story telling as well. This is the second of the entire Star Wars series of movies and in no doubt, the best. Not even the movies that come after were able to capture the landscape of this great cinematic achievement.Don't dare call yourself a Star Wars fan if you have not seen it.? ~10
