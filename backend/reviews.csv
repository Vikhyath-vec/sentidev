Movie Name~Date~Title~Review~Rating
Arjun Reddy~29 August 2017~May be the first modern cult classic in telugu~"It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.

Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.

The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations.

The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says ""a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet""; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.

The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.

Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years."~8
Arjun Reddy~25 January 2018~Strong characterisation .. But story makes no sense!!~"Ok, I am lost here, saw this movie yesterday after all that hype and hungaama and I really don't get how this film is truly different and mind-blowing! Are people only talking about the characterisation, which I will agree is quite strong and unapologetic. Vijay Deverakonda lives and breathes into this role. He is soo natural, almost too natural making us wonder if he has the same off-screen personality as well, which is a bit scary.

Coming to the story, I am really not sure what the director wanted to convey. Did he want to tell us that it is bad being rude and acting on impulse .. and that such people strongly needs therapy?? I understand that Arjun Reddy has anger issues and acts impulsively, but it is soo stupid that his love interest, Preeti also does the same, where she was supposed to be the sane one. She gets married to some random dude, despite being totally in love with Arjun because he did not answer his phone for a single day due to a drug overdose!!!??? And this is what people are calling as a revolutionary cult classic!!!

The second half is full of his downward spiral of Arjun Reddy and it is tedious watching this! Despite all his doings, he suddenly has flashes of remorse, especially in front of the lawyers and this is soo unconvincing. The ending saves this film a bit but makes all his suffering almost pointless. At any moment, Preeti could have ended his suffering instead we get a sub-plot with a film star thrown in and also countless moments where Arjun Reddy almost gets to kick the bucket!

Really, all this could have been justifiable, if the conflict point between the two lovers was strong. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, it is the weakest aspect which brings the entire film down."~3

Arjun Reddy~26 August 2017~Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.~"Arjun Reddy (2017): Arjun Reddy got immense craze which is no less than the craze Kabali got.Youth went crazy after watching its trailers and posters especially because of its cuss words and kiss scenes which are quite bold to Telugu audience.But what came as a surprise is its realistic and honest portrayal of love stories.

Plot: Arjun Reddy (Vijay Devarakonda), an ortho doctor has issues with alcoholism. He is an efficient ortho surgeon, but on the personal front, he is an alcoholic. And the reason for his turning into one is his love failure during his college days in Mangalore Medical College.While in college, he falls for first year student of MBBS. Preeti (Shalini) too likes him and their edgy love affair begins. Her father doesn't agree to their relationship and a huge tussle happens between Arjun Reddy and Preeti's family. This results in Preeti's father marrying her off to another person.After knowing that she got married, Arjun Reddy turns alcoholic and his anger issues further escalate. He becomes a modern-day version of Devdas who takes to alcohol, drugs, and tries to distance himself from the society.Rest of the story showcases the journey of Arjun Reddy as to how he regains his senses and gets back to normal.

My Review: Arjun Reddy may have attracted audience with all the cuss words and smooches but it is one of the most realistic love stories in recent times.Arjun Reddy is like Kumari 21f of males.Sandeep Vanga has chosen an unconventional way to give new feel to audience.

This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy, and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep presents Vijay's character from different perspectives and from each point of view; we get to understand Arjun even better. For Arjun's father, his son's actions are stains on his prestige. For his friends, Arjun's actions show his recklessness and free-spirited attitude. For Preethi, Arjun's actions show his madness and unwillingness to change, which she eventually embraces.

There are lot of amazing scenes in the movie which has immense depth in it.Especially the scene where Arjun rejects a guy who came to marry his friend's sister because that guy talks cheap about females.That shows the true nature of Arjun Reddy.The scene where heroine tries to calm down infuriated Arjun is one of the best scenes of the year.

It's not the number of lip-locks or the use of expletives that make Arjun Reddy a brave film. What really makes it a brave film and its director, a man with guts, is that it ventures into a space Telugu cinema has dared to enter and I doubt if it will ever. It shows that any story, when told with conviction, will be accepted and celebrated.

But the major drawback is its lengthy duration which is 3hr 06 min.Almost 30mins of the movie can be edited out as most of the scenes feel repetitive in second half.It is clear that director did not want to lose any detail of Arjun reddy's fictional life but he should have written some strong scenes which are entirely missing which make us feel Arjun's pain.

Vijay Devarakonda stuns you with his performance which is surely award winning. The way he brings the pathos and pain in his character is something else and drives the film completely. His dialogue delivery, the aggression he shows and the emotional manner in which he showcases his love is superb.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.

Rama Krishna who played Arjun's friend is brilliant as he entertains with his witty dialogues reactions.Actress Shalini may not look pretty but gave good performance.Yesteryear actress Kanchana is very good in the role of free-spirited grandma.

Songs are good but its the BGM which is the soul of the movie.It elevated proceedings in brilliant way.

So,Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.

My rating 7.5/10"~8
Arjun Reddy~7 February 2019~Absolute Crap~~1

Arjun Reddy~28 August 2017~Arjun Reddy is a dam Fuc...g Trend setting movie.....~~9
Arjun Reddy~2 September 2017~Arjun Reddy is life and not just a movie~"Disclaimer: Not for telugu movie lovers who want 4 songs, 3 fights, couple of high budget sequences and 1 freaking mega family hero.

This movie is an awesome mirror to how the present generation in India is. The story line, screenplay and the BGM are top notch.

Movie starts off with the main character looking shoddy (like a modern day devadas) and his only intention is to flirt, f*** and finish off. it is only when you slowly slip into the movie that you realize that either you or one of your friends from college is of the same type. Anger management is the main theme of the movie and the director intelligently shows the difference in mindset of the character per and post falling in love.

The supporting actors are like the friends of ours who are like shoulders to cry on or sit accordingly

Got to give credits to the Director for running the movie for full 3 hours without the distracting love duets/mass songs ( saved 25 mins of his time to convey the story better)

The subject line is raw and to the point with the plot revolving only around the hero. At no point one feels bored (unless someone doesn't like the plot all together).

BGM by the music director is amazing. it goes slowly and smoothly with the mood of the movie

Main let down would be the climax: which looked hurried and commercialized for the movie buffs"~10
Arjun Reddy~29 August 2017~This film is a sensation!~"Kudos to director Sandeep for coming up with a bold and one-of-a- kind film in Telugu. He sticks to his script without any deviations. Sandeep is definitely a daring director, who has shown a new way forward with Arjun Reddy.

This is Vijay Deverakonda's film all the way. He is sensational as Arjun Reddy. He completely transforms into the character and lives it. Undoubtedly, he is going to be the future poster-boy of Telugu cinema. He acts effortlessly, just like an experienced star. Rahul Ramakrishna as Vijay's friend is another surprise find, mouthing his dialogues in a natural way. Shalini makes an excellent debut, and shows no signs of being a newcomer. She is perfect for her role, which she carries with grace.

Arjun Reddy, it sure is a sensation for Telugu cinema, and all the credit goes to director Sandeep for coming up with a subject like this. Although this is his debut film, one feels like he is an old hand. On his part, Vijay Deverakonda brings Arjun Reddy alive. A film not to be missed!!!"~10
Arjun Reddy~15 March 2018~This is what cinema should be!~"Sitting in my room, my mind is still probing the edges of this one of a kind, beautifully executed, epic journey of a deeply flawed character that the director wanted to take us on. He has one message - love in any form is pure and free from any constraints that our culture might seemingly shackle us in.

In the first act, I hated this character that was supposedly the movie's protagonist. In fact, you will like any other character over him apart from the girl's father, and that sure is a warning sign for any story. I thought I would end up disliking the movie, which almost everyone has praised. But as the film progressed, I found myself getting hooked. This director, almost implausibly, made it work, and I couldn't praise him more for handling such a tricky, controversial plot so seamlessly.

With every scene, the director drags you into the messy life of Arjun Reddy. You will disagree with most of his actions, yet you find yourself relating to him. The director makes it work by focusing on the things which we all share, his emotions, his love for Prithi, and his passion for his field, the sincerity and candor in his dialogues. Every scene was shot beautifully, was interesting, and was important to the film, which is impressive considering the film was 3 hours long. It is also very easy to fall into the trap of using commonplace, hackneyed characters as your supporting cast with such a complex main character. You won't find any of that here. Each character is unique, and feels like a gust of fresh air in today's movie industry. More importantly, they all seem real. Not once, do you find any of the characters acting out of the personality and role the director has fleshed them in.

Kudos to the whole team of Arjun Reddy. You have sculptured a wonderful picture! You are the guys who are keeping cinema alive."~9
Arjun Reddy~28 May 2019~A Very Well Made And Acted Upon Bad Film!~"Not much to write for the storyline. By this time all know it. It revolves around a brilliant addict who has no control over his emotions. The story revolves around his love interest and some subsequent traditional but unconvincing development in relationship.

The lead role is played with a passion. Almost analogous to Joker by Heath Ledger. You will be convinced that he lives that life. This lifts the film from an otherwise average to super-hit standard.

I call it bad because

a. It portrays a very wrong picture of Indian girls. Like they loved to be conquered by a bull. This is not the case in reality.

b. Very conventional definition of the hero. Yes hero and not protagonist. A man born with a golden spoon automatically comes first in every sphere of life and surrounded by chamchas (followers).

c. It justifies drug, alcohol, unjustified anger and even rape attempt just for self satisfaction. At the same time covers and justifies it well with glimpses and suggestions of intellectual reasoning.

I am worried that this is the reason this film is getting such a high. Most of them are surely from young males."~3

Arjun Reddy~17 April 2018~Worst movie on the planet~~0
Arjun Reddy~9 September 2017~Arjun Reddy Master Piece, Path Breaking, Trend Setter of the Decade~"The movie is all about the attitude of Arjun Reddy,his love,ambitious way,especially anger guy. In telugu industry we don't seem this kind of movies for past decades. A trend have to introuduce as of moment in telugu.

Vijay Devarakonda and Direction,Story,Screenplay are the Heart of the movie. We cant take down any of these. Vijay perfection acting felt us a different guy in T'town and finally got Star crazy. Direction appreciable, new guy to industry where he puts whole heart and has given master piece to telugu people. The movie is out standing of every character so many characters relative to real life especially telangana local language used in very descent. Actress wow she is good supporter and Friend Character of Hero was impressed us so much. All elements put in the movies. only thing is Its a youth movie A Certified but all centers people loved this and smash hit this time.

I hope to get so many awards and rewards to this film. Till so many appreciations from critics also. I hope so strong Vijay will be the Best actor in filmfare awards where he missed the award with pelli choopulu. Vijay acting in a failure lover character is really great much"~10
Arjun Reddy~30 August 2017~Arjun Reddy' is not a film; it's an experience that'll stay with you.~"The love in Arjun Reddy is pure, unabashedly bold and hard-hitting. It touches the soul in ways it can't be explained. It gives the story a modern-day Devdas twist, while making the overall cinematic experience a journey to remember for a long time.

This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy(Vijay DeveraKonda), and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.

Sandeep and Vijay, as director and hero, make the film for what it is, and both have paved the way for a new chapter in Telugu film History. If it was Pellichoopulu and Kshanam last year, it's Arjun Reddy in 2017, and these films assure there is light at the end of the tunnel.

As much as the film belongs to Sandeep, who is also its writer, it equally belongs to Vijay Devarakonda, who is the life of Arjun Reddy. Vijay breathes life into the character and it's impossible to imagine anyone else in his shoes. Be it his passion, love, and rage; he portrays these several layers of his character with unparalleled realism.

Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.

Arjun Reddy most original, experimental and daring work to come out Telugu cinema in a long time."~10

Arjun Reddy~3 September 2017~This is a great movie.~"If I would describe this movie in one word. I would describe it as RAW. Raw emotions, Raw anger, Raw jealousy. You would feel it , you would be involved in it. Props to the director and the actor Vijay Deverakonda who plays Arjun reddy. Their brilliance makes this movie amazing. A master piece in its own right to the Telugu cinema industry. The story line is believable, the characters while extreme at times come back as real people with their own flaws. While there wasn't enough depth to shalini pandey's character, It makes sense to not have it as the movie wasn't about her character.

The direction is top notch. Im not a big fan of the background score but it wasn't distracting and kept me involved at the right times. Props to the actor Rahul Ramakrishna who played Shiva. We are you sometimes, in the movie, with your reaction matching mine.

In an industry stale by big names, the same directors. Which prints out the same old move with a ""twist"". This is a refreshing change."~10

Arjun Reddy~29 August 2017~Vijay Devarakonda all the WAY!!! Beginning of a Cult...~"Met expectations and was in line with the plot which trailer conveyed. Performance of VSD as Arjun Reddy was amazing as a crazy lover boy with anger management issues... the characters were well written and convincing performance from the others...Shiva, Gautam, Dean, Preeti, her Dad. Arjun's Dad, Granny, Preeti's Mom n Sister were not convincing compared to others. Music score was good...3 songs registered in mind and the background score was too good at certain portions of the film. Screenplay was captivating...St.Mary's college, Royal Enfield, the beach house, Alcohol, Preeti. Dialogues were very enjoyable and had a free flow mostly...comic bits were natural. No vulgarity and no obscenity. The portrayal of emotions for the lady love by the protagonist and the attention to details was very impressive. A thoroughly researched effort by the writer. Medicos and their fraternity have a film in their kitty and have a score of 1: n (engineering). ""A"" rating is justified keeping our societal norms in mind but for millenials it's acceptable in general. Congrats to the entire team!!! VSD has evolved from YvdSubr to Pellichoopulu to #ArjunReddy and is become a promising actor in the Telugu film industry. The climax was all Happy Endings....which could have been different....an abstract ending would have been much more apt...for all those who cant talk good about this flick - will sign off saying...Em matladuthunnav raaa... *#£"~9

Arjun Reddy~5 August 2019~My Man Arjun!~Man, this is a good movie--I'd go as far to say a masterpiece even. This movie goes far beyond the cookie cutter trends of millennial Telugu cinema. Deverakonda's consistent portrayal of the steadfast Arjun Reddy Deshmukh gives the movie a raw gripping vibe which you just cannot find in other movies. His character is flawed, especially in the second half when his relationship with his beloved Preethi, well portrayed by Shalini Pandey, reaches a standstill. Nevertheless, his undying love for her, and his refusal to waver in his beliefs, is quite laudable in my opinion. Though I would say the movie does exhibit some misogyny of sorts, especially regarding the issue of consent, I feel like the movie itself does subtly address these notions and attempts to ensure it doesn't go out of hand. Arjun makes regrettable mistakes, that I must cruelly admit are often amusing for the viewers in the cinema hall to watch, but the presence of Shiva, exceptionally portrayed by Rahul Ramakrishna, his devoted companion, makes his frequent falls from grace harsher than what reality would have for him otherwise. And by the way, Rahul's natural acting truly shines in this movie, and really tips the scale for this movie--securing it a spot as one of my favorite pictures of all time, one that I would watch any day, any second, as opposed to one that I'd watch once or twice and be done with. I encourage anyone who reads this to see this gripping cult-classic for themselves. It will really make you question your beliefs on the boundaries of a romantic relationship, and sheds new light on the extent to which people are influenced by the magic (or debatably curse) of love.~10

Arjun Reddy~16 September 2017~Thought provoking movie👍~Great performance by Vijay Devarakonda... I think he will be called as Arjun Reddy from now on. His performance is of such brilliance. This movie is one to watch with an open mind. Don't watch it if you are those close minded fools who think kissing and sex is vulgar. However its not a movie for kids. So be matured before judging the movie. There are good and bad qualities in the lead role. That's what makes it interesting. The lead has some anger issues, an alcoholic, then becomes a drug addict. So he faces lot of problems because of such addictions and anger issues. But the lead has many good qualities like self confidence, free spirited guy. He has some great human values however the movie really projects how worse a person can get if he can't control his anger. Youth must not blindly follow Arjun Reddy's mannerisms because it can lead to very bad consequences but must understand that the importance of anger management and also how dangerous addiction can be to oneself. So please watch with a clear mindset and don't impersonate Arjun Reddy's anger and addiction. All actors did great job. I appreciate the lead's friend character. That is a true friend for life. Recommended to watch!~10
Arjun Reddy~9 November 2017~Brilliant!!!~"Holy s**t!

This is the best movie i have seen in this year so far. A great movie depicting love, loss, pain, heart-break, anger management, suffering, coming to terms with life and blends everything seamlessly in a nice package.

Storytelling is brilliant and revolutionary. Direction is splendid. Screenplay is brilliant barring some stupid mistakes especially during the ending. Not every story needs to be a happy ending. The whole movie was a gritty depiction of suffering due to heart break and has been build seamlessly but is sacrificed in the end only for having a happy ever after ending. The writer could have gone some other way to end the story. That would have looked more realistic. The whole film was so pragmatic but ending was out of the sync and turned every buildup into a non-viable mess.

The character of Arjun Reddy is well written but somehow falls into unrealistic zone. Admit it, He was a contemptible fellow yet director revers him almost like a superhero. That somewhat vexed me.

Other than that everything is superb. Innovative story telling, Stylish and deft direction, adroit cinematography, Beautiful music and bang on performances, everything was so proficient in its place. The depiction of love and its suffering is so raw and naturalistic. Three cheers for the director (forgive me, i don't know his name) for addressing such a novel issue in his very first directorial attempt, that too in such a bold way.

Overall a landmark in the Telugu cinema and a must watch film for every one for its cynical nature and its unique take on love, life and loss."~9

I don't even want to give 1 rating.. We need negative rating in IMDB for these kinds of movies!!

Most of the scenes are only bedroom scenes where he could have made P**N movie instead and they portray this is love..

Last 5 minutes, hero realize and change his character (pathetic!) and heroine agrees and accept him.

It also glorifies all the negativities and is not good for society.

The success of this movie shows how the current generation are!!

This movie is so overrated and overhyped. Nothing in this movie are good and only kissing scenes are more. This movies is so long and its very boring."~1

Arjun Reddy~9 March 2020~Arjun Reddy- Not a Hero, but still my Hero!~"Arjun Reddy Deshmukh is a house surgeon in a medical college with some excellent credentials to his name. 'He is a topper of his class, topper of the university, topper of the board; I can say he is one of the best students to pass out of St Mary's with an impeccable academic record' his dean announces to a class full of new joiners, much to their delight and amusement.

Let us take a quick look at the definition for the word 'HERO'. It is a Noun that means 'a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities'.

Does Arjun fit that definition of a Hero? Sure... Why not!

But Arjun is not just all that. He is a ton of other things too! What follows that announcement is a needless faceoff between the Dean and Arjun that makes him ready to even quit his college. He even challenges- 'I am not a rebel without a cause Sir' with a chest filled with pride. Impulsive, rebellious, Arrogant and Hot-Headed, Arjun shows off a few other dimensions!

Where are we on fitting him into the definition of a Hero now? And where will it be when I tell you he also becomes an alcoholic, drug addict, apparent womanizer, convicted criminal and a suspended doctor! He definitely lost his way somewhere and has fallen light years short on being labelled a hero, I think.

But why? Why did his life turn upside down? He fails to let go off something important to him. A girl, that he falls in love with at first sight of her. A girl for who he can let pride take back seat and stayed back in the college for. A girl for who he can do every letter of the word 'everything' or will die trying. Yes, letting go is an easier and smarter decision to make. But he simply can't. It is that irrevocable adulation for her, that unadulterated affection for her, that selfless connection for her that doesn't let him. And those are the qualities that I find just as heroic. Heroic in the world of love!

Arjun is not a simple character by any stretch of imagination and an abstract limited definition does no justice to deciding if Arjun is a hero or not. I don't care what the dictionary has to say... He is definitely my hero for the passionate personality he is.

Arjun Reddy is an ode of love for Love!"~9

Arjun Reddy~2 May 2018~Arjun reddyyyyyy.... An extraordinary Movie~"Arjun Reddy (Vijay Deverakonda) is a vintage Bullet-riding, football-playing, angry, young final year medico who believes his actions are always justified. Preeti (Shalini Pandey), a first year student, walks into his life and it is love at first sight for the protagonist. She is a stark contrast to everything he is and at first, it seems like he bullies her into spending time with him. But time passes, love blossoms, passion roars, and nowhere does his fire lessen.

But things change; circumstances force Arjun away from his love and he seems to hit rock bottom with a force that's surprising, yet expected. He turns into a modern day Devadas, complete with a dog by his side. From a brilliant young man whose only issue was his anger, he turns into a raging alcoholic who smokes pot during his downtime and does coke whenever it gets too much. Despite all this, he continues to practice as a surgeon at a hospital till life threatens to throw him on his back again.

There's one dialogue in the movie that perfectly sums up the character of Arjun Reddy. Priyadarshi, who plays a cameo in the film, calls Arjun a 'free spirited individual in a democratic world'. There's nothing more apt than that to describe a character that you would both love and fear if you met him in real life. With 'Arjun Reddy', Sandeep Vanga has managed to tell a story that is seldom told, without sleaze or cheesy lines or OTT drama.

The protagonists of this film refreshingly refuse to confirm. All things scandalous to the world become but a way of life for Arjun. He questions the righteous middle class morality that society keeps throwing at his face, and lives his life without giving a damn. Even while turning to drugs, alcohol and casual sex, there's an I-don't-give-an-eff attitude about Arjun. For him, these are just means to an end -- an escape from his heartache. The writing is so real, the acting so raw that you forget Arjun Reddy is a character played by Vijay Deverakonda. You feel this the most when in a key scene before the interval you face a heartbroken Arjun Reddy and realise you too are left with a broken heart and lump in your throat as well. After a light-hearted film like 'Pelli Choopulu', Vijay Deverakonda has proven he's more than just a pretty face, by carrying off a character as complex as this.

Preeti, on the other hand, starts out as a timid student you believe is being bullied and transforms into a woman who's right in her convictions and strong enough to stand by them.

While Vijay Deverakonda is hands down the star of the show, and Preeti manages to come a close second, it is the character of Arjun's friend Shiva (Rahul) that deserves a special mention. He manages to be the sunshine in a world that keeps getting darker for Arjun. Kanchana who plays his grandmother in the film pulled off the role with beautiful ease too.

The dialogues, characters, instances in the film are so raw and realistic, one almost does not mind the long run time that drags in the second half. What also deserve a special mention are the beautiful songs, with music director Radhan doing a brilliant job of them. 'Arjun Reddy' is simply put, the dawn of a new era of films for the Telugu film industry."~10
