Breaking Bad~4 July 2021~Really Great~I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it.~10

Breaking Bad~9 November 2021~Damn near perfect!~"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!? "~10

Breaking Bad~13 November 2017~Among the best and most addictive shows there is~'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox~10

Breaking Bad~30 July 2021~99.1% pure~One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.? ~10

Breaking Bad~12 January 2014~If you mix Scarface, Robin Hood and maybe Tyler Durden with enough meth - you'll get a mean cocktail called 'Heisenberg'~If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic.~10

Breaking Bad~19 February 2020~The Best~I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.1,543 out of 1,700 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? ~10

Breaking Bad~9 December 2022~Absolutely Brilliant!!~Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!? ~10

Breaking Bad~9 November 2021~By far the greatest show I've ever watched~Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u).? ~10

Breaking Bad~3 March 2023~Truly Amazing, Wonderful, 99.1 Pure Perfect ‚≠ê~This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. Even if you're going to watch for find the flaws, I bet you can't find real major flaws in this serie. You know some people are just tries to find nonsense things in contents. (I mean in a movie or TV show) They are hard to pleased but even those people can enjoy this serie, because they really can't find one easily.I don't know how Vince Gilligan think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. He's a true genius that deserves so much more. He shared the golden age of TV Shows with Game of Thrones. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. And it ended with the best way possible.The actings are quite remarkable. I don't know how we were'nt know the name Bryan Cranston, I don't know how he didn't became a big star before this show. Giancarlo Esposito, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn Jonathan Bakns and Bob Odenkirk is also pretty amazing. Nearly all cast did a perfect job.Cinematography is so good in this serie. Not only looks great but also brings realistic style with that shaking camera sequences. You feel the moment with silence.Costume Design is also underrated. Did you know that characters has his own colors that reflects his personality? I know, it isn't a secret, many people know that but it really is something great.Also makeups are pretty good, did you know Bryan Cranston had hair when he's bald? Yes there was hair behind that. I know it's not that hard thing to do, It's not magic. But also wounded characters are too realistic. Especially Jesse's wounded face.~10

Breaking Bad~26 February 2009~Mind Blowing~"BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite ""Must See"", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.789 out of 1,059 found this helpful.

Breaking Bad~8 February 2015~arguably the greatest dramatic series... ever?~"It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth ""Emperor"" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the ""This... is not Meth"" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.Often with a show it's easy to let things slip, even (or especially) on the great shows when it comes to character dynamics, repetition, things that can be hard to control over the space of such a long period of time. But everything is so carefully mapped out, season after season, for the unpredictable to keep happening and for the dramatic beats to gain tension and mystery. Just take how the writers set up, so patiently, over a season, the opening clues of objects and debris all outside of a house, and when you finally find out what all this is about - BAM right to the gut.What one comes away with, outside of the tremendous performances (you might gripe that Cranston got too many Emmys, but... what didn't he deserve with every fiber of his acting bad-assery?) and the consequences that are built up for all the characters, including those we think are made of rock and steel (Mike Erhmantraut), is the world of moral terror. What is morality in this world? There isn't any. It's the Wild West, but crossed with something like, I dunno, American Beauty. What happens when you take a hardcore drug-gangster tale of suspense and warp it with dark comedy about what it means to be a man in society today, or what it means to have a family (and believe me, there are many moments that are downright haunting, harrowing to the soul that speak to this, especially as it builds and builds in its last eight episodes)? You get... this. Perfection.I wish I could tell you there's problems with the show, but rarely can I find any. I'm sure if I dug deep enough some might be there, a clich√© exploited for the drug-war scenarios or having a baby around for easy drama or theatrics. But so many times on this show you - or I should say I - get thrown curve balls that really have no other way of working out except how they do. When a moment like Walter White in his crawl space discovering a terrible revelation and going from agony to abhorrent laughter arrives, it's just one of those amazing moments of drama in any American medium. It might be throwing praise like gravy on a Thanksgiving platter, but I'm reminded of Nicholson's comment once on Kubrick: everyone acknowledges he's the man, and I still think that underrates him."~10

Breaking Bad~27 June 2017~Addicted: Meth or Math.~"Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: ""No thank you"" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see ""Breaking Bad"" again. I can't wait."~10

Breaking Bad~11 October 2022~If I could rate it 20/10, I would.~"Where do I even begin? The writing is near perfect, the actors and characters are all amazing, the over-arching story just gets only better and better. This show is just a bullet train, this just goes and refuses to stop. It pulls no punches, everything that happens has all the impact. And honestly, there isn't a single bad episode. Every episode, yes even ""Fly"", serves a purpose, and honestly, shouldn't be skipped over upon first viewing. And for a show that ended in 2013, it's still relatively popular and beloved among people. Everyone I know still loves the show and loves it to death.There isn't much else to say, other than that this show is perfect. 10/10.? "~10

Breaking Bad~26 January 2008~Hello, Mr. Cranston - Meet Ms. Emmy...~"As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did ""father NOT know best"", but more than likely never would.Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel.Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer.Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to ""ask nicely.""Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been ""edited for time and content"" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it."~9

Breaking Bad~13 October 2019~The 10/10 show.~If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest.? ~10

Breaking Bad~29 October 2022~The greatest TV show of all time.~Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time, and you can tell very easily because it's lowest rated episode has a score of 7.8. There are few other shows that can come close to the level of Breaking Bad, and one of them is it's own spin-off show, Better Call Saul. No other show in television history has had as long as a powerful and lasting impact on human culture, not even the longest running shows of all time, not The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Law & Order, SpongeBob SquarePants.Breaking Bad may have the greatest cinematography on television and the acting is an astonishing compliment. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman, Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut (the kid named finger), and many more of the characters in Breaking Bad are some of the greatest characters of all time, in movies and television, as a matter of fact, the greatest written characters in the history of stories, in human history, which is an incredible feat.Breaking Bad is amazingly engaging and is one of the few shows that makes you feel like you are the characters. When it ends, you will want to re-watch it for the rest of your life. Breaking Bad is a show so good that it is the greatest show on television, and it's spin-off show is right behind it.Breaking Bad started a seventh of a century ago and ended a decade ago, but it still remains one of the most prominent shows in human culture, if not the most prominent and prolific. It's only matched against SpongeBob SquarePants, but not even SpongeBob and Patrick can trample Heisenberg and Cap'n Cook.Breaking Bad is 99.1% pure.Breaking Bad is numero uno.Bravo Vince.~10

Breaking Bad~21 January 2008~Brilliant Character Work In Pitch Black Comedy-Drama~"The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, ""living realistically as a middle class in the United States"" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like ""Bad."" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he ""never smoked."" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea."~9

Breaking Bad~20 May 2019~Since GOT is over, this is Officially the Greatest show ever made~I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing.1,293 out of 1,584 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? ~10

Breaking Bad~3 February 2023~The Greatest TV Show of All Time~"I wish I'd never seen it so I could see it for the first time again.It's the story of an underappreciated chemistry teacher with terminal cancer who decides to ""break bad"" and get into the drug business to ostensibly make a quick buck for the sake of his dependent family before kicking the bucket.But of course things aren't so simple. Even though Walter is a scientific genius and has most of the answers, he doesn't have all of them. On top of that, things aren't so easy as they look.Even at face value, this plot is compelling and the product does not disappoint in that regard. This is a substantial work in the action genre with superbly directed scenes of violence and rage.Yet the deeper level may be what takes Breaking Bad to the highest pinnacle of art. The series is marked by unparalleled intricacy in its characters dipped into this simple premise that would make quite an adventure on its own merits. Even characters which would usually be neglected, like Skylar, Walter's housewife spouse, is a tower of complexity. Her motivations, urges, and errors lead to dire consequences for others even though such a character as pregnant suburban middle class homemaker in work of realism would initially appear powerless.Over the course of the series, this intricacy of the characters coalesces into one of the finest works of tragedy in fiction. Hamartia in the form of excessive ambition, pride, or commitment combine with the simple truth that things aren't as clear cut as they appear at face value to lead to truly powerful scenes and explosive conclusions.A frank and mature exploration on the meaning of love, life, family, loyalty, and so much more.Not to be missed."~10

Breaking Bad~9 August 2021~As close as one can come to view perfection~Everything from the subtle details, to the unmatched writing and the perfect cast, to the very beautifully shot scenes. It may very well be the best Tv-show out there. The story, even with some creative liberties, is well grounded, believable and feels very real. The show, unlike others, ages like fine wine. The more you watch and the longer you sink in the better it gets. I can think of few series which grow stronger and better every season. It's not only worth sinking your teeth into, it's worth eating. Breaking Bad is a timeless piece and it will stand even long into the future, and will forever be one of the best Tv-shows to ever come out.? ~10

Breaking Bad~5 December 2016~chemistry in a cynical world~"Some years after writing for ""The X Files"", Vince Gilligan created a show. I only saw scattered episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" during its run, but I finally got around to binge-watching the first season. Bryan Cranston puts on one of the most chilling performances in TV history as a terminally ill teacher who turns to manufacturing crystallized methamphetamine to support his family. Basically, the show is about moral ambiguity and how actions have consequences. Indeed, each episode adds a new complication.When I first read about the show during its run, I saw a picture of Bryan Cranston with a beard, glasses, and a shaved head. Having known him as the dad on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", he looked unrecognizable in that photo. But he's proved himself to be a truly versatile actor in the past few years, with roles in ""Contagion"", ""Argo"", ""Godzilla"", and ""All the Way"" (as Lyndon Johnson).In the meantime, this show will offer some of the most unusual chemistry lessons. Outstanding show. It deserved every award that it won.I wonder if Vince Gilligan has ever gotten comments about ""Gilligan's Island""."~10

Breaking Bad~14 November 2017~Everything you already heard about this show - is probably an understatement.~"Everybody has their own opinion of how many stars a show deserves, whether more stars or fewer it's seldom so many people agree. ""Breaking Bad"" is possibly the best TV drama ever made - there isn't a wrong step, bad episode or miscast character throughout the whole series run.A willing suspension of disbelief is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is probably not plausible to believe that anyone like Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught let alone the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic characters, who nearly all resonate with most viewers, make you willing to set aside any differences with plausibility (which, admittedly, the show takes huge liberties with).Like most serials it is best not to watch the show out of order! More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you might not want to miss a minute in this original and daring TV drama once you start watching!"~10

Breaking Bad~25 February 2014~Brewing Bad~The outline is clear. Most people will know what it is about even those who haven't seen the show. The teacher who decides to take a step into darkness. And the consequences, he and others have to suffer because of that. Bryan Cranston is superb in his portrayal of Walter White the chemistry teacher, who after being diagnosed with cancer, decides to take matters in his own hands.Having met an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, both undergo a journey, that has its up and downs. But while Walter White has his family (and all the relationships feel realistic), there is a special bond that is hard to explain, between Mr. White and Pinkman. Trying to depict every little great aspect of the show would take too long. The show itself though does take its time, building up tension and when it gets released, it is heavy! Be it because of the action involved or the emotional impact.The first season may seem to have a very slow pace, but even so it has more than its fair share of great moments (I'll only mention the bathtub, which had me almost crying because of laughter). Season 2 picks up and there is almost no stopping after that. There are McGuffins here and there (like the eye of a teddy bear to name but one) and they all enhance the feeling that this show is real. Feels real that is. The show is obviously for mature audiences, because of its content. Which is the violence and the behavior of characters, not any nudity!~10

Every director who worked on the series did a great job.Writing: Very brilliant. The whole story of the series is impressively written.Acting: Absolutely fantastic! Every actor brings out their best.Editing: The editing is also very commendable! It's outstanding and unique.Soundtrack: Every song is great. There are a lot of vocal songs in the series, but for example, there is also the great, catchy intro by Dave Porter (who scored several songs for the series).All in all, this is a brilliant series that is absolutely worth watching. I can only recommend it."~10

Breaking Bad~6 December 2022~I have high standards~I binged breaking bad, worst mistake of my life, never binge a good show! Especially not breaking bad, binge it when rewatching, same experience. You can binge something multiple times, but you can only experience the show once. Anyways, on to the review.What hasn't been said about breaking bad? It's an absolute masterpiece that pretty much everyone has watched. It starts off with an insignificant highschool chemistry teacher and ends with a ruthless drug lord (hopefully not spoiling too much here). But this is not only the story of a broken man, what many (I think many people anyway) fail to acknowledge is the team that worked on breaking bad, the progression of the writing. The first season is a pretty good crime drama about a chemistry teacher breaking bad, nothing special. However, when you get to the last season, every goddamn frame is a breathtaking painting.If you're putting off watching this: I'm not going to urge you to watch it. Take your time, but still do watch it obviously.Breaking bad is what art is meant to be, a birth and a death. It was made with passion, not an endless money grab like the sitcom. I know it's been said over and over, but death is what makes birth meaningful and beautiful. Season 1 was good, but you need to watch the finale to fully appreciate the beginning. Breaking bad is the story of a man, but do not mistake it for a tragedy. It is simply the legacy of a prideful man. We all want our stories heard, we all want to live on in others, we are all desperately human. I simply ask you to keep the story of breaking bad going, watch the show and be grateful for Vince Gillian's creativity.~10

Breaking Bad~18 August 2022~Undeniably the Best~After huge recommendation and buzz about the series, I started watching on 2016 August, couldn't able to stop it. I have finished two seasons in a flight travel. The best show on the internet completely eligible to do binge watch. You will be travelling along their journey of Walter White or Jesse Pinkman. The show biggest success was how it ended, you can't a find better way to put through. I really wish would have got chance to watch in their release times.,? ~10

Breaking Bad~25 January 2014~A Series that Will Never be Forgotten,~Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone.~10

Breaking Bad~23 February 2008~Step aside Tony Montana, cause here comes Walter White.~What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while.~9

Breaking Bad~10 February 2022~MASTERPIECE~THIS SHOW IS IN MY TOP 5 OF THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED IN MY WHOLE LIFE!IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A SERIES TO BE AS GOOD, WELL COVERED AND WELL ACTED AS THIS ONE??? THIS IS IMPECCABLE.ALL PRAISE FOR THIS SHOW IS LITTLE.? ~10

Breaking Bad~18 December 2015~Brilliant - one of the greatest drama series of all time~Albuquerque, New Mexico. A chemistry teacher, Walter White, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. By chance he runs into a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a crystal meth dealer. This gives him an idea on how to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family upon his death...Fantastic series. Starts innocently enough and builds tension and momentum with every episode. So many dangers and hurdles in his path - from small time hoodlums to drug lords, his wife, plus Walter's own brother is a DEA agent!In addition, while their enterprise is a very illegal one and one with some unique challenges, Walt and Jesse's struggles are relatable. Most of the issues they face, especially initially, are what all small businesses face - finding a location, distribution, capital, supply, competitors, regulation, restless (in this case, homicidal!) partners/shareholders - and the series demonstrates this quite superbly.The Walter White character arc is also quite something to behold.It's not just about the plot though, everything about this show is fantastic. Direction is incredibly innovative, especially for a TV series. Clever use of camera angles and shot depth. It's the sort of stuff you only usually see in movies and then Orson Welles-directed ones at that.Wonderful cinematography and scenery: great use of colour and the vast, unspoilt New Mexico landscapes.Casting and performances are spot-on: nobody puts a foot wrong.Absolutely brilliant.~10
